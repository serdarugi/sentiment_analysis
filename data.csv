>According to the report, ocean acidification is one of nine critical Earth system processes, or [planetary boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html), responsible for regulating life-support systems on Earth. The planetary boundaries create a safe range for humans to maintain a stable and resilient Earth. When a boundary is surpassed, the likelihood of permanently damaging Earth's life-support functions increases significantly. With each boundary crossed, the risk of irreversible damage rises even more.

>Six of the nine planetary boundaries have already been violated, per the Potsdam Institute [report](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/earth-exceed-safe-limits-first-planetary-health-check-issues-red-alert), and if trends of ocean acidification continue as researchers have predicted, a seventh breach is not far behind.

hsvo2s,The U.S should rebuild Puerto Rico as a model for Climate Change resilient infrastructure after the next hurricane. What would that look like?,"Every time a hurricane ruins a North American city I come back to the same idea - we need to start testing the best climate resilient infrastructure techniques for coastal areas.

Puerto Rico seems like a great place to start since they are in desperate need of stronger infrastructure, destructive hurricanes are frequent, their systems are not interconnected as they’re on an island, and the scale of the project is feasible to do quickly. As a bonus - investment would be good stimulus spending and set them up for a potentially independent future. I envision it would become a proving ground for technologies such as:
- state of the art power grid 
- advanced sea walls and water diversion
- tidal, wind, solar and nextgen or modular nuclear power
- satellite/balloon based wifi/internet/cellular

MIT engineers made a cheaper and more efficient device to trap carbon dioxide

December 1, 2019

Capturing carbon dioxide from smokestacks, and even removing it directly from air, might be the only way to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change. Engineers at MIT have now created a device to trap carbon dioxide that is much less energy-intensive and costly than today’s technologies.

The device, reported in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, works a lot like a battery. It absorbs carbon dioxide from air passing over its electrodes. It could be made as small and large as needed, making it easy to use at different carbon dioxide emission sources.

And unlike today’s carbon-capture techniques, it works for a wide range of concentrations. So it could be used to scrub carbon dioxide from factory and power plant flue gases or even directly pull it from the atmosphere, where it’s present at much lower levels.

Existing methods to absorb carbon dioxide from flue gases typically use watery solutions of amine or solid sorbent materials. The solution has to be heated to release the carbon dioxide and reuse the amine. This takes a lot of energy. Plus, the technology does not work at the lower concentrations found in air. Companies such as Climeworks have developed commercial plants that use special filters to suck up carbon dioxide directly from air. But the filters also have to be heated for reuse.

The new MIT system uses only electricity, so it could be powered by renewables. The device contains two thin, flexible electrode sheets coated with two different chemical compounds. During charging, one of the compounds, called polyanthraquinone, reacts with carbon dioxide and integrates the gas into the electrode. Discharging releases the carbon dioxide and frees up the quinone for reuse.

The idea is to pass a stream of flue gas or air through the device during charging to scrub it of carbon dioxide from. Once the electrode is saturated, the device would be switched to discharge mode and the pure released carbon dioxide could be compressed for storage underground or for use to make fuels and other chemicals. Or two separate units could be operated in opposite modes to remove carbon dioxide continuously.

The system uses about one gigajoule of energy per ton of carbon dioxide captured. Other existing methods can use up to 10 times that much, according to Sahag Voskian, a chemical engineering postdoctoral researcher who developed the new technology. He added that the electrodes should cost tens of dollars per square meter to produce, and could easily be made in large quantities using roll-to-roll processing techniques.",1575298887.0,82,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e507sm/mit_engineers_made_a_cheaper_and_more_efficient/,carbon intensity,Positive

en5baq,Representation of Climate Change in Video Games.,"I wanted to know what people more educated than I thought of games that tackle climate change. A lot of people complained that it was political in civilization 6 and wasn't backed by science. I will explain how it works in game and I would love to hear your opinions if it is scientific or not. 

In Civ 6, burning fossil fuels cause the global temperature to rise. Slowly at first, but it becomes exponential. As the temperature rises, the ice caps will melt, causing low level land to be reclaimed by the sea and causes more frequent and intense natural disasters like hurricanes and floods. You can also do carbon recapture, but I don't think it helps after the ice caps melt.

px4f4f,The role of labor and capital in the generation of CO2 emissions," Our research showed that for the world's leading emitters of China, India, and the United States, compared to the fixed capital usage, the employment of the primary input of labor induces a larger amount of carbon emissions. Therefore, along with better management and utilization of fixed capital resources, the focus should be on labor training and reallocation of labor from highly carbon-intensive to less carbon-intensive industries (sectors). Furthermore, unclean imports and financial services to major carbon-importing sectors should be strictly supervised.

9568wk,Is the concept of enhanced weathering or soil remineralization a generally supported idea among climate change activists/scientists?,"I've been, since college, fairly interested in the science of climate and climate change.  Somewhere along the way I was introduced to the idea of enhanced weathering.. Is there a decent body of research on the topic?  is it generally supported? 



 [Enhanced weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering) refers to
> ""geoengineering approaches that use the dissolution of natural or artificially created minerals to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Since the carbon dioxide is usually first removed from ocean water, these approaches would attack the problem by first reducing ocean acidification. ""

Not long ago i stumbled upon [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0108-y.epdf?author_access_token=w1xYBFb3g3BwKnjkBD1cJtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NSaZpth7Zz94N6_lHXNgths4xErTsML30mZS8Ql0FCuzY9k6ePi5nMsoEvmCXoU5g65l-c0C09tp3iWQMGMdfvbuwlRhm5_snv9tqy8Kc6ig%3D%3D), which states 

>The aim of enhanced weathering is to accelerate the natural geological process of carbon sequestration with the production of alkaline leachate that reduces ocean acidification. It is achieved by modifying the soils of intensively managed croplands with crushed calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg)bearing rocks. 

and 

>Significant potential exists for large-scale deployment of ground 
basalt to remove atmospheric CO2.

and argues that there could be significant secondary benefits from the whole process..

>Besides removing CO2 from the atmosphere, we discuss how this strategy has the potential to also rejuvenate soils, stabilize soil organic matter, improve crop yields, conserve geological fertilizer resources and benefit the marine environment

>Adding crushed silicates to soils... will probably have further economic benefit due to their ability to help replenish eroded soil and enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) content, both serious global concerns threatening food security

_

>Cation release from basalt weathering increases the cation exchange capacity of soils and nutrient availability and could improve SOC sequestration by resulting in higher inputs of organic carbon from roots and mycorrhizal fungi, which themselves promote soil aggregate formation and SOC stability

_

>Enhanced weathering strategies not only capture carbon but 
could also help to restore soils and resupply impoverished reserves 
of trace elements that are important for human nutrition and crop 
production

_

>..enhanced silicate weathering can be expected to increase dissolved 
silica fluxes to rivers and oceans. This may partially help to mitigate 
the effects of N and P in runoff from agricultural regions. Increased 
Si:N and/or Si:P ratios in runoff reaching coastal waters from soils 
amended with silicates might favour the growth of diatoms over prob
lematic non-siliceous algae that produce toxins, red tides (dinoflagellate blooms), foam (Phaeocystis blooms) and scum (cyanobacterial blooms). Such a changed nutrient balance could also beneficially preserve or increase downstream food web and fisheries production because diatoms are the preferred diet of pelagic and benthic grazers, mostly copepods and bivalves, and increase marine biological CO2 drawdown and storage with economic benefits in particular regions. For example, the Great Barrier Reef is adjacent to the main sugarcane growing regions in Australia, where adding crushed basalt to soils may not only enhance sugarcane production, but also improve runoff and ground water chemistry while countering ocean acidity via the addition of alkaline leachate..

The paper argues that there could be a slew of potential benefits from a simple, albeit resource and labor intensive, process... A lot of potential benefit.  Is there a good catalog of research available? I know about the group Remineralize the Earth, which funds small projects and research, but their list of research is largely non-peer reviewed and largely from non-english speaking countries.  Anybody have any thoughts on the topic?

[John Hamaker
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Hamaker) was a guy who thought soil depletion and carbon dioxide accumulation were triggers for not just worsening weather trends, but also increased tectonic and volcanic activity and eventually large scale glaciation. I'm not saying I think he is correct about it all(although his ideas were endorsed by buckminster fuller and some other scientists), but it is an interestingly simple explanation for a complex system.  Does it garner any respect?

>[Par. 4]&nbsp;&nbsp;Several studies have already established that reservoirs (hydroelectric and others) emit GHGs, notably CO2 and methane. The intensity of emissions varies greatly from one system to another. The new study is based on estimated emissions from 9,000 reservoirs on five continents, and shows that total reservoir-induced GHG emissions peaked around 1987 – in connection with a period of large dam construction – and at that time the dominant gas was CO2.    
      
>[Par. 5]&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, methane emissions dominate, and the contribution of this gas compared with CO2 will continue to increase in the future. The reasons for this are complex but partly because in existing reservoirs CO2 emissions decrease more quickly over time. Also, some new reservoirs expected to be built in warmer climates in the future could potentially involve higher methane emissions, depending on the site.    
            
>[Par. 9]&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that the design and operation of dams can be changed to mitigate a part of methane emissions. For example, by drawing water closer to the surface, we can significantly or totally remove emissions from methane degassing. In one example, in Malaysia, we observed that if the intake was located a few meters higher in the reservoir, we estimate that we could decrease the amount of methane released by about 90 per cent.

>The likely global importance of CH4 degassing is also interesting from a GHG management perspective as it suggests some potential to limit or reduce reservoir CH4 emissions. G-res output suggests that if all reservoir CH4 degassing were eliminated, global GHG fluxes from reservoirs would be reduced by 31%–52%. Because high degassing fluxes are most likely to occur when water is drawn through a dam from a reservoir's hypolimnion [*footnote], where low-O2 conditions allow CH4 to accumulate, constructing dams that draw water from well-oxygenated near surface portions of a reservoir's water column or managing water withdrawals to minimize release of hypolimnetic waters  could substantially reduce downstream degassing CH4 fluxes. For example, a simulated increase in water withdrawal depth by as little as 3 m (from the hypolimnion to the metalimnion) yielded a 92% reduction in CH4 degassing emissions from a Malaysian reservoir (Batang Ai) (Soued & Prairie, [2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020GB006888#GBC21136.indd%3Ahl_gbc21136-bib-0031%3A31 ""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020GB006888#GBC21136.indd%3Ahl_gbc21136-bib-0031%3A31"")). It is also possible that retrofitting existing dams with epilimnetic water withdrawal structures or hypolimnetic aeration systems could reduce downstream degassing, while also likely mitigating  other  environmental  impacts  of  dams  on  downstream  ecosystems (Michie  et  al., [2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020GB006888#GBC21136.indd%3Ahl_gbc21136-bib-0019%3A71 ""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020GB006888#GBC21136.indd%3Ahl_gbc21136-bib-0019%3A71"")).

1g2wyry,Methane vs. carbon dioxide infrared absorption ,"I have read that methane is tens to a hundred twenty times stronger a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Is this true? If so, where is the data for this? PNNL's graphs of absorption cross-section seem comparable for carbon dioxide in the 14-16 microns range and methane for 7-8 microns: relevant to the greenhouse effect. I downloaded and analyzed the HITRAN spectral line intensities for carbon dioxide and methane in those ranges. The highest line intensity for carbon dioxide in its range was three times higher than for methane in its range. The average line intensity was seven times higher for carbon dioxide. The sum of line intensities was higher for carbon dioxide than for methane.  I looked at the infrared spectrum from Coblenz on the NIST website. Conditions were a little different but the results seemed comparable to me, not a factor of a hundred. Earth's thermal spectral density seemed only ten percent stronger at 7.5 microns than 15 microns. Methane concentration in the atmosphere looks to be half a percent of carbon dioxide. So, I just don't understand how methane would trap 100X more (or even 10X more or just more) heat than CO2, either per molecule or per volume of the lower atmosphere.

witmtp,ocean PH vs CO2 as a viable metric for rapid change inducing severe outcomes,"Hi - I was looking at some climate change data a bit more closely, and I noticed that while co2 is measured in PPM on what appears to be a linear scale, PH is measured to only two places, and is logarithmic. To me, a typical person who looks at CO2 rising in parts per million isn't going to worry. It's some pseudoscience or mumbo-jumbo.

But a person who notices the PH change substantially, may understand or appreciate the risk more. I believe this might help to encourage people to alter their choices sooner. Noticing things change in parts of a million is less concerning than noticing things change in parts of a hundred. Is this reasoning accurate?

What is the difference between CO2 and PH, if you normalized the values over a recent time period and put them onto a 1-10, then a 1-100, or a 1-1000, or a 1-10000, or a 1-100000, or a 1 to 1000000 linear scale?

I'm happy to elaborate on this if you don't understand, or explain it differently if I have demonstrated a reasoning flaw or mathematical mistake.

My guess: If you normalize PH and co2, and put them on the same chart, and either have an interactive website, or have a short video, showing how the tiniest rises in CO2 cause large changes in PH, and also - including that moment during the rise when the fish can't survive, when the calcium in coral reefs and snail shells begins to dissolve, and when other sea life simply starts to die, I guess then you would have a useful tool in a toolkit.

A tool like that would help people appreciate how CO2 is a very important figure to study. It would encourage widening nature corridors around waterways, connecting currently isolated areas of habitat so flora and fauna can migrate. This type of detail, if frequently broadcast on television or advertised properly, would help people appreciate the urgent need to avoid the most polluting sorts of activities, those most resource intensive ones.

You could even have a slider where you manually adjust the co2 and it shows the PH, indicating as different types of sea life fails and becomes extinct due to the ocean acidification changes.

I have found some links, connected loosely but associated. I didn't see anything like what I have described. I'm very sure it would encourage people to be more appreciative of those who practice conservation or who focus on the more difficult parts of life, such as avoiding food waste, or avoiding large pet ownership, or those who focus on in parallel, health, diet and maintaining key skills, like being able to walk long distances, or ride bicycles, or to embrace detail and complexity, or to be able to self-moderate the urge to live 'grandly' or 'richly' in a way that doesn't value the importance of the land used. It might encourage people to cease watching video streams (TV, youtube) or computer gaming constantly. It might encourage them to eat differently, to reduce the situation where livestock for food is over-consumed. Or where it's inappropriate from a land occupation and species and diversity conservation perspective. If there is something like what I described, I'd love to know!

cqlbeu,Reflections on how Canada can achieve and go past its Paris targets,"I've been doing lots of research in my spare time about what sorts of transformations are needed for the world (mostly Canada though) to achieve its Paris goals and successfully transition to a low-carbon economy. I've come across a few evidence-backed recommendations that could get Canada to meet and/or go past its Paris goals by 2030.

\- Alberta has the potential to increase the share of solar and wind in its energy mix to 10 and 15%, respectively, as the federal price on carbon and the coal phase-out eliminates coal from the mix while favouring leakage-free gas production.

\- No more fossil fuel extraction infrastructure should be built, and we should close emissions-intensive projects before the end of their extractive capacity. [Source](http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2016/09/OCI_the_skys_limit_2016_FINAL_2.pdf)

\- Additional carbon tax of $6/t per year past price of $50/t in 2022 until 2030 would close the 71 Mt emissions gap between the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change and the Paris goals.

20taok,Mechanical Carbon Capture and Sequestration is not the Answer to our CO2 problem,"So I've been reading a little bit about this new carbon capture technology.  Basically, air is sucked into this kind of filtration system which then sequesters it into underground storage like an old oil well.  Supposedly, these systems will pull CO2 out of the air faster than natural sources like plants will.  While I don't dispute that particular claim, I think it misses the point.

When you create a CO2 molecule, you lose an O2 molecule.  This is why my lawn mower needs to have the choke wide open to run.  The O2 (air) is sucked into through the intake, helps facilitate the burning of the fossil fuel, combines with a carbon atom, and is shot out the exhaust. 

Carbon capture and sequestration seems to simply take the CO2 out of the air and not replace it with O2.  So in addition to the sequestration, you would need something like an artificial photosynthesis “machine” to suck that carbon back out of sequestration, separate the carbon from the O2 molecule and put the O2 back into the air.

Another issue here is that Carbon Capture and Sequestration requires energy.  More specifically, it requires man-made energy.  So these units need to be near some kind of power station.  This draws power away from industry and homes, and will most certainly lead to more power needing to be produced.  Power is still (for the most part) a dirty business and will pump more CO2 into the system.

It seems to me that this is a bit of a progress trap.  It's like we think we can fix everything by inventing some new gadget, but we fail to see the wisdom in what other affects that gadget has.

Plant life existed on this planet long before animals ever came into existence.  In fact, and argument can be made that plant life is what made this planet habitable to animal life in the first place.  Plants and animals live is a sort of “CO2 symbiosis”, where animal life converts O2 to CO2 and plants convert CO2 to O2.

Plants require sunlight, water and some soil nutrients (amounts and types vary among species) to create O2 from CO2.  During this process, the plant not only creates O2 but many other products that can be used by Humans as well.  Food and Wood are two things most people think of, but there are others.  Plants can produce the building blocks of bio-fuels.  Dead plant matter can help restore topsoil erosion.  

What I would suggest rather than relying on one more man made gadget, is to begin to terraform and replant multilevel “permaculture” style forest gardens.  

The terraforming involved is basically to create a system of small swales or ditches running mostly level and parallel to ground contours.  This creates a system of capture, that does not allow water to shed off the land.  The water is absorbed into the ground rather than flowing into streams and rivers.  There would also be some pond retention systems.  For a much more well written and detailed description, one could refer to “Water For Every Farm: Yeomans Keyline Plan” by P.A. Yeomans.

These swales would be placed in intervals of 30 to 50 feet up and down the land slope.  Below these swales, a row of trees would be planted.  These trees could be a mix of local wild, and product trees like Fruit and nut bearing species.  Intermittently, within the row, vines like Grapes could be planted.  Southerly of the row, a tall shrubs row could be placed.  Southerly again, a row of shorter shrubs, and so one down to grassland.  

Again, please refer to “Restoration Agriculture” by Mark Shepard for more detail.  But the long and short is that you create a landscape that: creates O2 from the abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere, requires no man-made energy once it is in place, heals land, and creates potential crops for human use and consumption.

This could be done on a massive scale across the farmlands of the US that have been decimated by mono-cropping, or on reclaimed industrial or residential areas that have gone by the wayside.  Since we are talking about such a huge swath of land, it may make up for an individual plants' ability to capture and convert CO2.  While I haven't seen studies on the requirements for replanting, I'd be willing to wager that this would put a massive dent in the excess CO2.

The process of doing this would also create a lot of jobs.  And while this would be a fairly labor intensive process, it isn't rocket science.  The kind of work that is being discussed here is done by earthwork contractors and landscapers every day.  People could be easily trained to do this.  It also doesn't require huge machinery (and thus huge amounts of fossil fuels) to do either.  It could literally be done with simple surveying equipment, a small tractor with a few attachments, and a team of 3-4 people each.  

Once the system is in place, it would actually create more jobs as well.  Without huge swaths of acreage to sow, spray, and harvest, the era of the large tractor combines would be over.  Manufacturers would need to downscale agriculture equipment, making for some “creative destruction”.  But needing a new kind of equipment, would keep many of those same businesses in place.    More human labor would be required as well, simply to maintain and harvest these areas.  

What I am basically putting forth is a modern twist on what the Civilian Conservation Corps did in the 1930's to deal with the Dust Bowl that struck most of the American Midwest. 

Then maybe add to this the use of Carbon Capture & Sequestration in urban and industrial areas if needed.  But I don't think the mass use of Carbon Capture & Sequestration Technology is going to be the answer here.

I invite discussion and criticism.  I don't claim to have all the answers.  My name is Patrick and I'm just a guy with an interest in this stuff.  But I have a baby boy and I want to leave him a better world than I inherited.  My wife says I'm a little “crunchy”

\--

Fight Climate Change with your Everyday Purchases & Use Your Wallet to Demand Sustainability from Companies

**The Details:**  

* Consumer Spending is 70% of the economy - companies listen to consumer spending; let's use that to push companies to be greener. 
* It's hard to determine the climate impact of any one purchase, but in aggregate can figure out the impact of a type of purchase (like Clothing which is 8-12% of US carbon emissions).  We can also figure out which companies in a category are better or worse on climate impact (like Patagonia being better than Zara)
* So, using your purchasing data (i.e. credit and debit card spending), we can ""round up"" each purchase based on the approximate carbon impact (category + company), then use the rounded up funds to buy carbon offsets. 
* Then, you'll see that your spending is costing you X Dollars per month in carbon impact, so you'll want to change your spending to be greener - to buy less of the high carbon categories, from companies that lead on sustainability.

**How It Works:** 

1. **Connect** securely to your bank accounts and credit cards using Industry Leading technology.
2. **Purchase** as you usually do and the app calculates the Carbon Intensity based on the purchase category and company.
3. **Round Up** the purchase based on the Carbon Intensity, and deduct the difference from your bank account.
4. **De-Carbonize** by automatically using the Round Up money to fund carbon offsets, climate advocacy, and research.
5. **Adapt** your spending habits to be more climate friendly by acting on insights in the app.

Example: Buying Gas

* $22.86 - Fill up your gas tank
* $25.00 - Round Up to the nearest $5 based on the Carbon Intensity of Gas
* $2.14 - Deducted from your bank account to fund American Forest Foundation carbon offsets

Example: Ordering Takeout

* $48.43 - Order from your favorite local restaurant
* $49.00 - Round Up to the nearest $1 based on the Carbon Intensity of Food
* $0.57 - Deducted from your bank account to fund climate advocacy campaigns

**Monetization/Business Model:** A small percentage (\~3%) of the Round Ups would go towards app development; then there's a monthly Pay What You Want fee (can be $0).",1604610628.0,0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/jor6rz/would_you_use_an_app_to_optin_for_a_carbon_tax_on/,carbon intensity,Positive

1ea495i," The Impact of Climate and CO2 on Flora, Fauna, and Energy","Vegetation does not grow in the extreme colds found at the North and South Poles. The only wildlife that can survive in these climates relies on consuming marine life, which requires temperatures high enough to maintain liquid water. The greatest flora and fauna diversity on Earth exists in the tropics, which are the warmest and wettest non-marine environments on the planet. Increasing CO2 levels reduce the water requirements for all flora, increasing yield and available nutrition for all fauna, even in desert environments.

Heat is energy. A colder planet would not only increase global power demands, as heating homes is more energy-intensive than cooling, but would also reduce the available energy to heat homes. Heat can be turned into electricity in several ways, such as with a thermoelectric generator. Solar panels lose efficiency in colder environments, and battery performance declines in lower temperatures. Hydroelectric power obviously needs warm enough environments to keep water liquid, but it is aided by the precipitation of liquid water, which decreases when temperatures fall.

Carbon only makes up 0.025% of the Earth’s crust, while CO2 accounts for only 0.04% of the atmosphere (\~418 ppm). This means that out of roughly 2,392 molecules of air, there is just 1 molecule of CO2, and yet people think that’s too much. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which is why ice cores drilled for historical CO2 levels will always show extremely low and consistent amounts. When water freezes, it always does so from the outer layer inward, sealing off atmospheric CO2 from getting in. CO2 is also a result of some aerobic reactions, which only take place where there is heat above the freezing point of liquid water.

Regardless of these facts, we can engineer solutions to address the challenges of global warming. However, when it comes to global cooling, there is little we can do except burn fuel and use nuclear energy.",1721729753.0,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ea495i/the_impact_of_climate_and_co2_on_flora_fauna_and/,carbon intensity,Positive
1c8f66x,Can we fix it?,"Project Proposal: ""Cold Earth Initiative""

Introduction

The ""Cold Earth Initiative"" is a forward-thinking project aimed at drastically reducing global carbon emissions through a combination of advanced renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, tidal), reforestation, and innovative carbon capture techniques. This proposal elaborates upon prior discussions, providing an actionable and detailed plan to reverse the adverse effects of climate change by integrating sustainable practices across different ecological zones globally.

Project Overview

Objective: To implement a multi-faceted global strategy that not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes environmental rehabilitation through renewable energy, reforestation, and enhanced carbon capture technologies.

Duration: The initiative is projected to span 30 years, during which full implementation and scaling of the technologies and strategies are expected.

Total Project Cost: The project is estimated to cost approximately $3.3 trillion USD, representing a significant global investment into sustainable future.

Scope: The project includes extensive installation of solar panels across 50% of the world’s suitable hot deserts, wind farms on uninhabited islands, and reforestation in arid regions using methods proven successful by China’s greening efforts.

Financial Details

Funding Strategy:

•	Global Contribution Model: This involves an equitable cost distribution among the world's population, exempting those below the poverty line and low-income families, to ensure fairness and feasibility.

•	Individual Contributions: By excluding financially vulnerable groups, the burden is shared among approximately 3.6055 billion people.

•	Per Person Cost: Each person is expected to contribute $915.18 over 30 years, which breaks down to about $30.51 per year.

Projected Financial Outcomes:

•	Break-Even Analysis: The initiative is designed to break even within 100 years, considering savings from reduced energy expenditures and economic growth spurred by emerging industries related to renewable technologies.

•	Post-Break-Even Profitability: After the break-even point, substantial profits are expected due to decreased operational costs and increased efficiency from mature renewable energy technologies.

Environmental Impact

Carbon Reduction Goals:

•	Solar Panels: Implementing solar panels in desert areas could generate significant electricity, effectively decreasing reliance on carbon-heavy fossil fuels.

•	Wind Farms: The strategic placement of wind turbines on uninhabited islands will harness potent wind energies while preserving ecological integrity.

•	Reforestation: Turning arid regions into thriving forests not only sequesters carbon but also restores biodiversity and stabilizes ecosystems.

•	Tidal Power: Including tidal power projects enhances the mix of renewable energy sources, providing consistent and reliable power outputs.

Total Emission Reductions: When fully operational, the initiative is expected to significantly cut global carbon emissions, aiding in the stabilization of global temperatures and contributing to international climate goals.

Social and Economic Impact

Job Creation:

•	This project will likely create hundreds of thousands of jobs worldwide, spanning various sectors including construction, engineering, maintenance, and operations.

Economic Development:

•	By reducing global dependence on expensive fossil fuels, the project will lower energy costs and foster economic growth in newly developing sectors like renewable infrastructure and environmental restoration.

•	Comparison with Other Initiatives: Similar to the job creation seen in major infrastructure projects like the U.S. Interstate Highway System, which not only built extensive road networks but also significantly boosted local economies through job creation and increased commerce.

Health and Environmental Benefits:

•	Improved air quality and reduced health risks will decrease medical costs and enhance quality of life. This is similar to the benefits observed from other large-scale environmental initiatives like the Clean Air Act in the U.S., which significantly improved air quality and reduced pollution-related health issues across the country.

Global Participation and Equity

Responsibilities of Partner Countries:

•	High-Income Countries: These countries are expected to contribute more, reflecting their higher economic capabilities and historical contributions to global emissions.

•	Middle-Income Countries: They will contribute according to their economic capacity but will also benefit from technology transfers and capacity-building to boost their local industries.

•	Low-Income Countries: These nations will receive support through international aid, ensuring that they are not overburdened financially and can still benefit from the project's environmental improvements.

Risks and Challenges

Technical and Logistical Challenges:

•	The sheer scale and complexity of the installations pose significant technical and logistical challenges, similar to those encountered in global initiatives like the International Space Station, which required extensive international cooperation and technical expertise.

Environmental and Social Risks:

•	Potential disruptions to local communities during construction phases must be mitigated through careful planning and stakeholder engagement, drawing lessons from projects like large dam constructions, which have historically led to significant environmental and social impacts.

Consequences of Inaction

Accelerating Climate Change: Without decisive action, the progression of climate change could lead to catastrophic natural disasters, mirroring scenarios predicted in climate models that show increased frequency and intensity of weather events. Economic Strain: The costs related to inaction, such as disaster recovery and increased healthcare spending, could far exceed the investments outlined in this proposal, similar to economic analyses of prolonged wars which drain resources and stagnate economic growth. Biodiversity Loss: The ecological degradation could mirror the mass extinction events of the past, permanently altering life on Earth and disrupting food chains and ecosystems. Social Instability: The potential for climate-induced migration and conflict could increase, akin to historical conflicts fueled by resource scarcities.

Conclusion

The ""Cold Earth Initiative"" represents a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change, modeled after successful global initiatives that have shown significant long-term benefits despite high initial costs. This project is not only an investment in environmental sustainability but also in economic stability and social well-being. Its success hinges on global cooperation and a commitment to a sustainable future, emphasizing that despite the daunting scale and cost, it remains a necessary undertaking to ensure the planet's health and humanity's survival.

olksgb,Pleasant experience,"Was on vacation this past week and the rental company stuck me in a hybrid Toyota RAV4. It was actually a pleasant experience and has me interested in purchasing a hybrid for my next vehicle if not a total electric car. 

Having said that I'm a little skeptical of climate change. By skeptical I don't mean that I do not believe it is happening I just wonder about the percentage of contribution by mankind and how big of an effect it will have combating it. Seems to me no matter what we do we are on the eventual path of climate change anyway. That doesn't mean I feel we should throw our hands up in the air and forget any attempt to correct it. However, as a conservative, I believe we need more climate change advocates that lead by example and not just by verbal language. 

For instance the people in Hollywood who I think are a bunch of clowns own huge mansions private jets private yachts- they preach to people about sacrifice and saving the planet yet they live luxurious energy wasting lifestyles that most of us will never experience. In addition, to make the movies that they sell to us must waste the equivalent of providing energy for a whole town for months on end. Their films require transportation for all film members actors supporting cast supporting staff, living quarters, post-production processes that involve high intense computer work, and much more. 

Next the politicians - is it really necessary to have these meetings halfway around the world Many of them using private transportation to get there , staying in lavish hotels, and all the other wasteful energy consumption they do to have these meetings. It's not necessary. Having a zoom meeting would be just as effective. They're preaching to us about the changes we need to make without really making any of the sacrifices themselves. 

We need a reasonable approach without the extremists from both sides. The idea that we would be totally electric in a decade Is not realistic.  Air transportation alone will need to stay with fossil fuels for quite some time. I know I wouldn't feel comfortable in an electric jet until it's had quite a long time of research , development and trials. 

Plenty of conservatives I know are behind the idea of addressing climate change and/or pollution. To attract even more I think we need to get away from the overused and redundant verbiage that constantly comes from the media- existential threat being the number one offense. Stop it already. It's an important issue that needs to be addressed and as I mentioned before reasonable solutions should be enforced. The extremist calling for us to do away with eating natural meat and switching over to lab grown meat, That's just insane to me and you're going to lose a lot of people with just that solution alone. Stay focused on electric vehicles which we have been. Work on carbon capture so we can have something to help while we are implementing this changeover and allow time for more solutions to come to the table.  We can attain a smoother, less interruptive transition with this method. 

As for me, I have changed all my windows in my house to double pane, led lighting, fuel efficient car, efficient washer and dryer, I keep my AC at 80 while I'm not home. I used to collect the shower water with a bucket while it was heating up and use that water to flush the toilet however my wife got sick of the bucket being in the in the shower.. Haha

18f51x9,How Solar panels are made,"
Many have been conditioned to believe that solar energy is a green technology the they generate zero GHG. Unless you  understand how things are made you would believe this. But if you are really interested in making this planet better you would try to understand how every energy technology  is made so you can understand the trade-offs or determine for yourself if it is good for the planet.

There are basically five (5) processes to make solar panls. The first process is making the raw feed called silicon  dioxide (SiO2). Silicon Dioxide comes from either Sand, quartz rock or diatomaceous earth in  for of silica dioxide. Quartz rock is the most common. Quartz rock goes through a variety of energy and mechanical intensive unit operations to produce the silicon dioxide feedstock for solar. The mining operations include excavation, crushing, grinding, washing, flotation, leaching, drying and other processes. These are large scale facilities muck like you would see with any other mining operation. You produce a raw crystals and toxic byproducts from the leaching process. 

This raw silicon dioxide then goes to the second process to make metallurgical grade silicon. This involves heating the SiO2 between 1800 to 2000 degrees and adding carbon (C)  to remove the oxygen (O2). Carbon and oxygen form CO2 and CO the same green house gas that activists want to stop oil companies to produce by burning fossil fuels. What makes this process worse is in order to get to the high temperature you need to heat the SiO2 in blast furnaces that mostly use coal in China and natural gas in other parts. There is being used electrical furnaces to replace the coal but these still need a huge source of power mostly from fossil fuels. So you get double green house gas generation from silicon dioxide. These furnaces are huge and require lists of energy to produce. All adding to the demise. 

The next process is the produce semiconductor and solar grade silicon from the metallurgical grade silicon. Solar grade is very high purity. So the is further leaching and refinement required. Mostly housing hydrofluric acid, boron and other chemicals. This also requires very high purity water. Again, it is an energy intense process and produces further toxic materials that need to be handled.

The next process is to produce the silicon Wafers or polysilicon.  A lot of improvements have been made to make this as green as possible but still energy is required. 

The last process is the bulk manufacturing taking the various other materials needed to assemble the panels. 

Material handling of all of the requires shipping , transportation, huge mining equipments and  trucks,  conveyor systems and much more just to get the materials to your house. All generating green house gasses. 

Pundits will work to ring a hole in this write up but the simple chemical fact is you need high purity silicon for solar and you currently use lots of energy, produce tons of CO2 (GHG) and have terrible toxic waste that we have to deal with.",1702219394.0,0,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/18f51x9/how_solar_panels_are_made/,carbon intensity,Positive

",">**Global methane emissions have surged, undermining efforts to curb climate change. Human activities continue to drive emissions from fossil fuels, agriculture, and wetlands, pushing warming beyond safe limits.**

>Methane emissions, a major contributor to climate change, have continued to rise without slowing down. Despite a global pledge by over 150 nations to reduce emissions by 30% this decade, new research reveals that global methane emissions have surged at an unprecedented rate over the past five years.

>The trend “cannot continue if we are to maintain a habitable climate,” the researchers write in a Sept. 10 perspective article in *Environmental Research Letters* published alongside data in *Earth System Science Data*. Both papers are the work of the [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/), an initiative chaired by Stanford University scientist Rob Jackson that tracks greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

>The current path leads to global warming above 3 degrees Celsius or 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century. “Right now, the goals of the Global Methane Pledge seem as distant as a desert oasis,” said Jackson, who is the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the *Environmental Research Letters* paper. “We all hope they aren’t a mirage.”

Here's a fascinating observation in the article about the impact of the pandemic on atmospheric methane accumulations:

>Our atmosphere accumulated nearly 42 million tons of methane in 2020 – twice the amount added on average each year during the 2010s, and more than six times the increase seen during the first decade of the 2000s.

>Pandemic lockdowns in 2020 reduced transport-related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which typically worsen local air quality but prevent some methane from accumulating in the atmosphere. The temporary decline in NOx pollution accounts for about half of the increase in atmospheric methane concentrations that year – illustrating the complex entanglements of air quality and climate change.

Staggering. Unnerving. Mind-boggling. Absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.

As global temperatures shattered records and reached dangerous new highs over and over the past few months, my climate scientist colleagues and I [have](https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1709825752705753105) just about run out of adjectives to describe what we have seen. Data from [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/september-2023-temperature-update/) released on Wednesday shows that September was an astounding 0.5 degree Celsius (almost a full degree Fahrenheit) hotter than the prior record, and July and [August](https://berkeleyearth.org/august-2023-temperature-update/) were around 0.3 degree Celsius (0.5 degree Fahrenheit) hotter. 2023 is almost certain to be the hottest year since reliable global records began in the mid-1800s and probably for the [past 2,000 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0400-0) (and [well before that](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/july-2023-is-hottest-month-ever-recorded-on-earth/)).

While natural weather patterns, including a [growing El Niño event](https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/), are playing an important role, the record global temperatures we have experienced this year could not have occurred without the approximately 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) of [warming to date](https://climatechangetracker.org/igcc) from human sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. And while many experts have been cautious about acknowledging it, there is increasing evidence that global warming has accelerated over the past 15 years rather than continued at a gradual, steady pace. That acceleration means that the effects of climate change we are already seeing — extreme heat waves, wildfires, rainfall and sea level rise — will only grow more severe in the coming years.

I don’t make this claim lightly. Among my colleagues in climate science, there are sharp divisions on this question, and [some](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2023/07/23/climate-crisis-warming-is-right-in-line-with-early-predictions-but-many-of-the-impacts-are-exceeding-predictions_6063986_114.html) aren’t convinced it’s happening. Climate scientists generally focus on longer-term changes over decades rather than year-to-year variability, and some of my peers in the field have expressed concerns about overinterpreting short-term events like the extremes we’ve seen this year. In the past I doubted acceleration was happening, in part because of a long debate about whether global warming had paused from 1998 to 2012. In hindsight, that was [clearly not the case](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22315). I’m worried that if we don’t pay attention today, we’ll miss what are increasingly clear signals.

I wouldn’t be making this argument if I didn’t have strong evidence to back it up; the data we’re getting from three sources tells a worrying story about a world warming more quickly than before. First, the rate of warming we’ve measured over the world’s land and oceans over the past 15 years has been 40 percent higher than the rate since the 1970s, with the past nine years being the nine warmest years on record. Second, there has been [acceleration](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/14/JCLI-D-21-0895.1.xml) over the past few decades in the total heat content of Earth’s oceans, where over 90 percent of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is accumulating. Third, [satellite measurements](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/science/) of Earth’s energy imbalance — the difference between energy entering the atmosphere from the sun and the amount of heat leaving — show [a strong increase](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.html) in the amount of heat trapped over the past two decades. If Earth’s energy imbalance is increasing over time, it should drive an increase in the world’s rate of warming.

There are a number of factors driving the acceleration of warming. While the world has [made real progress](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/25/climate/world-climate-pledges-cop26.html) in slowing down the growth of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, they have yet to peak and decline. And on top of this, we are reaping the results of what the climate scientist James Hansen [calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/opinion/columnists/the-faustian-bargain-of-reducing-air-pollution.html) our “Faustian bargain” with air pollution. For decades, air pollution from sulfur dioxide and other hazardous substances in fossil fuels has had a strong temporary cooling effect on our climate. But as countries around the world have begun to clean up the air, the cooling effect provided by these aerosols has [fallen by around 30 percent](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.html) since 2000. Aerosols have fallen even more in the past three years, after a decision to largely [phase out sulfur](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-low-sulphur-shipping-rules-are-affecting-global-warming/) in marine fuels in 2020. These reductions in pollution on top of continued increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations mean that we are encountering some of the unvarnished force of climate change for the first time.

Until recently, climate change was framed as an issue that would affect our children. Today it is nearly omnipresent, and it is impossible to ignore. And very soon, with the acceleration, we will experience even more of its effects: Ice sheets and glaciers will melt faster, extreme weather events will become more frequent, and even more plants and animals will be put at risk of extinction.

Does this acceleration mean that warming is happening faster than we thought or that it is too late to avoid the worst impacts? Not necessarily. Amazingly enough, this acceleration quite closely matches [what climate models have](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4/) projected for this period. In other words, scientists have long foreseen a possible acceleration of warming if our aerosol emissions declined while our greenhouse gas emissions did not. That’s what we’re now seeing. This may not make you feel much better about the future of warming but should at least make you feel better about our models and the power of science to prepare us for what’s to come.

It’s now clear that we can control how warm the planet gets over the coming decades. Climate models have [consistently found](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/) that once we get emissions down to net zero, the world will largely stop warming; there is no warming that is inevitable or [in the pipeline](https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/warming-in-the-pipeline-decoding) after that point. Of course, the world will not cool back down for many centuries, unless world powers join in major efforts [to remove](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-how-to-limit-warming-to-1-5c-or-2c/) more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we add. But that is the brutal math of climate change and the reason we need to speed up efforts to reduce emissions significantly.

On that front, there is some reason for [cautious hope](https://swac.umn.edu/events/kuehnast-lecture-2022). The world is on the brink of a clean energy transition. The International Energy Agency [recently estimated](https://www.iea.org/news/the-path-to-limiting-global-warming-to-1-5-c-has-narrowed-but-clean-energy-growth-is-keeping-it-open) that a whopping $1.8 trillion will be invested in clean energy technologies like renewables, electric cars and heat pumps in 2023, up from [roughly $300 billion](https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-low-carbon-energy-technology-investment-surges-past-1-trillion-for-the-first-time/) a decade ago. Prices of solar, wind and batteries have plummeted over the past 15 years, and for much of the world, solar power is now the [cheapest form of electricity](https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/). If we reduce emissions quickly, we can switch from a world in which warming is accelerating to one in which it’s slowing. Eventually, we can stop it entirely.

We are far from on track to meet our climate goals, and much more work remains. But the positive steps we’ve made over the past decade should reinforce to us that progress is possible and despair is counterproductive. Despite the recent acceleration of warming, humans remain firmly in the driver’s seat, and the future of our climate is still up to us to decide.

y2ev7z,Equip me in the debate on global warming,"Hey Reddit,

Since the start of my awareness of global warming I've been in support of the wealth of science supporting the theories about human activity affecting our climate. Recently I've been in discussions with seemingly learned people who questioned these beliefs and as a person who likes to get my data the right way I went about researching the topic when I came upon a very interesting article review about the subject in support of skepticism.

The article, ""The Global Warming Debate: A Review of the State of Science"" by Khandekar et. al. is from 2005, which is a noteworthy amount of time in such a well researched field. It's an interesting read though. (Not sure if I can link, Google scholar provides the pdf)

I then went about trying to find follow-up on the points made and if they have been clarified in recent studies but I've kind of hit a dead end.

Basically what I'm asking is: if and how the criticisms laid out by the authors have been dispelled. If you can offer some answers or at least point me in the right direction I'd be much obliged. 

The criticisms in question are mainly about:
The effect of urbanisation and land-use change
Solar variability
Extreme weather events and whether it's more a perceptional change rather than an actual change

If you haven't read the article please do. I'm not interested in general responses about what the science today is in agreement of (I am aware and not disputing it), but rather looking for answers on the specifics brought up in the article.",1665607241.0,476,220,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/y2ev7z/equip_me_in_the_debate_on_global_warming/,global warming,Positive
16g9ehy,I'm very disturbed by the number of people who support climate engineering,"It's really not a good idea. 

I'm going to list a few points that form the basis of my opinion that it's really not a good idea.

1. Carbon dioxide emissions aren't just warming the planet. They are also making the ocean more acidic. Oceans uptake CO2. This lowers the pH of the ocean in a process called ocean acidification. If we keep emitting CO2, even with a perfect geoengineering scheme that offsets CO2 warming perfectly (unlikely), the oceans will still become more acidic. This is a global threat to ocean life. We need to stop emitting CO2 for that reason alone. 

2. The Earth is warming nonuniformly. The Arctic is warming 2-3x faster than the rest of the planet, termed Arctic amplification. Any geoengineering scheme must offset not only the global mean rise in temperature but also the pattern of warming. Some studies suggest that injecting aerosol in the  stratosphere may not offset Arctic amplification. This means that even if the global mean temperature is held fixed, the Arctic temperature may continue to rise. This could still lead to sea level rise. 

3. Unintended consequences. As a climate scientist, I can tell you this: we don't understand everything about climate change. Not even close, and I'm not trying to make us look bad. It's just a fact most people outside of academia don't realize. An example is climate sensitivity. A basic question, ""how much does the temperature rise when doubling CO2?"" varies by between 2 and 8 K in models participating CMIP6. This enormous spread has gotten bigger despite our best efforts to constrain climate models. Along these lines, it's worth noting that you can change extremely esoteric parameters in climate model, like convective entrainment rate, and change the climate sensitivity tremendously. And we don't know why. Now, knowing this, do you really feel comfortable injecting Aerosol into the stratosphere when the only source of knowledge we have on the impacts this would have come from models? Models that can't agree on climate sensitivity for reasons we don't understand, despite decades of research? Let me be clear: we know CO2 is warming the planet and we know why. But there are tons of things we don't understand. Another example is the hydrological cycle. We don't have a full grasp of how/why precipitation will change from raising CO2. There are papers about it constantly. So, we certainly don't know what would happen to the hydrological cycle if we add Aerosol to the stratosphere. The fact is this: the consequence of injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere has a non negligible chance of making things worse. I don't have enough trust in climate models to make decisions about geoengineering based on their predictions, and this is coming from someone who works at lab developing climate models.

4. Frankly, the studies on climate engineering are not great and still in their infancy. Many studies on injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere model it stupendously crudely: they simply reduce the solar constant in a climate model by an amount that they assume Aerosols would dim sunlight. The reality is, injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere wouldn't be as simple as reducing the solar constant by a uniform amount globally. Aerosol can move. Aersol can interact with longwave radiation as well as shortwave. People of course know this, but modeling the physics precisely is a challenge that is still being incorporated into studies.

5. While I'm not an expert outside of the science side of things, I can't help but think about the international effort required to accomplish climate engineering. It would require international cooperation, tremendous technological advances, and money. A question: is it really easier to stop climate change by using engineering rather than using more sustainable infrastructure? To me, both climate engineering and developing sustainable infrastructure face the same difficult hurdles mentioned earlier: international cooperation, technological advances, money. So to me, it's not clear why climate engineering would be an easier way to solve the problem. Perhaps some people on this thread think it's necessary to work on both climate engineering and reducing CO2. Another question: would the resources spent on climate engineering be better spent on developing sustainable infrastructure? (I think you know my opinion on this).

Final thoughts: 
1. I want to mention something also many people on this thread probably don't realize. Most climate scientists oppose implementation of climate engineering. I work at a lab that employs _many_ climate scientists. Nobody here thinks it's a good idea. Even people studying climate engineering at my lab don't support it's use. 
2. This is far from an exhaustive list of drawbacks. 
3. I focused on Aerosol injection in the stratosphere, but other geoengineering schemes, such as cloud brightening, have been proposed. These face similar problems. 
4. I support further study of geoengineering. A model Intercomparison Project for it exists and is called GeoMIP. Note even GeoMIP acknowledges the potential for dangerous consequences associated with geoengineering. See: http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/geomip/

Edit: also wanted to mention that the only intervention I do support direct air capture. This is because zero emissions doesn't reverse global warming. We need direct air capture to cool the planet. See: https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/blog_held/23-cumulative-emissions/

Edit 2: It seems from the comments I have a bit to learn about DAC and the different methods of drawing down CO2. I'm not informed on the drawbacks DAC vs other methods. In complete honesty, I wrote DAC but was incorrectly using it to express my opinions about CO2 drawdown in general. All I know is this: we need negative CO2 emissions to reverse global warming. Temperatures _stabilize_ with zero emissions. Maybe DAC isn't the best way to accomplish negative emissions, but we do need negative emissions to reverse warming.",1694470873.0,375,360,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/16g9ehy/im_very_disturbed_by_the_number_of_people_who/,global warming,Negative

However, [Porto Alegre was technically prepared for such events](https://diariodonordeste-verdesmares-com-br.translate.goog/ultima-hora/pais/por-que-porto-alegre-alagou-entenda-a-calamidade-que-deixou-a-capital-sem-luz-agua-e-suprimentos-1.3509373?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp). It has a dike and drainage system that could handle up to 6m of water (relative to the Guaíba lake), more than the current flood (5.3m). Still, there was so much water that pumps started failing, causing more pumps to become overflowed in a cascade effect (it didn't help that the local government ignored some maintenances too).

**This is what extreme weather events look like.** You can tell yourself that you're safe because the geography of your area is different or that your local government is trustworthy, but ask yourself: are you really sure your city can handle 1,000mm of rain over a couple of days? Can the lake or river next to you handle it without overflowing? Can you reach the next city if all bridges get destroyed? Because extreme [rainfalls](https://www.nature.com/news/global-warming-already-driving-increases-in-rainfall-extremes-1.19508) and [hurricanes](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/09/warming-climate-makes-extreme-hurricane-rains-more-likely-for-puerto-rico/) are becoming more common thanks to global warming, and very few cities in the World are ready for this. The collapse of Rio Grande do Sul is a cautionary tale for the whole World.

18hnpja,"Phasing out animal agriculture represents “our best and most immediate chance to reverse the trajectory of climate change,",">“We wanted to answer a very simple question: What would be the impact of a global phase-out of animal agriculture on atmospheric greenhouse gases and their global-heating impact?” said Patrick Brown, a professor emeritus in the department of biochemistry at Stanford University. Brown co-authored the paper with Michael Eisen, a professor of genetics and development at UC Berkeley.

Based on the model, published in the open-access journal PLoS Climate, phasing out animal agriculture over the next 15 years would have the same effect as a 68 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions through the year 2100. This would provide 52 percent of the net emission reductions necessary to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, which scientists say is the minimum threshold required to avert disastrous climate change.

The changes would stem, the authors say, from the spontaneous decay of the potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide, and the recovery of biomass in natural ecosystems on the more than 80 percent of humanity’s land footprint currently devoted to livestock.

“Reducing or eliminating animal agriculture should be at the top of the list of potential climate solutions,” Brown said. “I’m hoping that others, including entrepreneurs, scientists and global policymakers, will recognize that this is our best and most immediate chance to reverse the trajectory of climate change, and seize the opportunity.”

Brown is also the founder and CEO of Impossible Foods, a company developing alternatives to animals in food production. Eisen is an advisor to the company. Both Brown and Eisen stand to benefit financially from the reduction of animal agriculture.

Unlocking negative emissions
Brown and Eisen are not the first to point out that ongoing emissions from animal agriculture are contributing to global warming. But what has not been recognized before, they say, is the much more impactful “climate opportunity cost” – the potential to unlock negative emissions by eliminating livestock.

“As the methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock diminish, atmospheric levels of those potent greenhouse gases will actually drop dramatically within decades,” Brown said. “And the CO2 that was released into the atmosphere when forests and wild prairies were replaced by feed crops and grazing lands can be converted back into biomass as livestock are phased out and the forests and prairies recover.”

Brown and Eisen used publicly available data on livestock production, livestock-linked emissions and biomass recovery potential on land currently used to support livestock to predict how the phaseout of all or parts of global animal agriculture production would alter net anthropogenic, or human-caused, emissions from 2019 levels. They then used a simple climate model to project how these changes would impact the evolution of atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and warming for the rest of the century.

They examined four dietary scenarios: an immediate replacement of all animal agriculture with a plant-only diet; a more gradual and, the authors say, more realistic, 15-year transition to a global plant-only diet; and versions of each where only beef was replaced with plant-only products.

For each hypothetical scenario, the scientists assumed that non-agricultural emissions would remain constant and that the land formerly used for livestock production would be converted to grasslands, prairies, forests and the like that will absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide.

“The combined effect is both astoundingly large, and – equally important – fast, with much of the benefit realized by 2050,” Brown said. “If animal agriculture were phased out over 15 years and all other greenhouse-gas emissions were to continue unabated, the phase-out would create a 30-year pause in net greenhouse gas emissions and offset almost 70 percent of the heating effect of those emissions through the end of the century.”

While the complete phase out of animal-based agriculture was projected to have the largest impact, 90 percent of the emission reductions could be achieved by only replacing ruminants such as cattle and sheep, according to the model.

While their paper does not explore the particulars of what a global phaseout of animal agriculture would entail, the authors acknowledge that “the economic and social impacts of a global transition to a plant-based diet would be acute in many regions and locales” and that “it is likely that substantial global investment will be required to ensure that people who currently making a living from animal agriculture do not suffer when it is reduced or replaced.”

But, they write, “in both cases, these investments must be compared to the economic and humanitarian disruptions of significant global warming.”

Changing attitudes
Many will scoff at the idea that billions of people can be convinced to switch to a plant-only diet within 15 years. To these skeptics, Eisen points out that other revolutions have happened in less time. “We went from having no cellphones to cellphones being ubiquitous in less time than that. Electricity, cars, solar panels – all became common in a relatively short period of time,” Eisen said.

Moreover, Brown added, societal attitudes toward food are far from fixed. “Five hundred years ago, nobody in Italy had ever seen a tomato. Sixty years ago, nobody in China had ever drunk a Coke. Mutton was once the most popular meat in America,” he said. “People around the world readily adopt new foods, especially if they are delicious, nutritious, convenient and affordable.”

The scientists have made all of the raw data they used, as well as their calculations and the computer code used to carry out the calculations, publicly available so that others can make up their own mind.

“The great thing about science is that, in the end, it all comes down to whether the conclusions are supported by the evidence,” Brown said. “And in this case, they are.”",1702492590.0,335,335,https://news.stanford.edu/2022/02/01/new-model-explores-link-animal-agriculture-climate-change/,global warming,Positive
1d0iyb2,Are the record high temperatures we are experiencing a result of global warming alone?,"I've been hearing about record high temperatures in every region. Ocean temp. are also rising, coral reefs are dying etc. In my region alone, with 12-15 months, there was an increase of 5-6 degrees C in winters. These things sound way too extreme. I've heard El Nino as another factor contributing to high temps.

But all of these seem to be happening way too fast, faster than what we expected or predicted. If this trend continues, then the next 5 years will have temp reaching 55 C in a lot of regions with 45 and 50C becoming common. It can't be this bad, right?

1fb1jsn,Off-the-charts warming in the Mediterranean. What's going on?,"I'm from southern Italy, in the middle of the Mediterranean basin. There is a weather observatory near me that has been active since the 1920s. The older data are incomplete and sketchy, but it's still a valuable time series that shows the dramaticity of climate change in the region. The data shows that there was a slow cooling trend between the beginning of the series and 1953, then a moderate warming trend until 1973, then another cooling trend until 1991, and then a much stronger warming trend that continues to modern day.

The most recent warming trend of the last 34 years has been much bigger than any previous trend. There is a 2.5°C difference between the late 1980s and modern day. That's approximately THREE times the global rate. And it doesn't look like it's going to stop anytime soon, in fact here is the list of recent records:

April 2018 was the hottest april ever

Overall 2018 third warmest year

August 2021 also the hottest ever

April 2024 second hottest

June 2024 third hottest

July 2024 second hottest

August 2024 second hottest

Overall summer 2024 second hottest (fitst place belongs to 2003)

Overall year 2024 hottest year ever BY FAR. Yes the year is not over yet, but at this point it's pretty much guaranteed that it'll end as the hottest year ever and by a huge margin. There would have to be a little ice age to bring the average down to non-record levels. 

I have cross-checked and confirmed these data and they hold true for much of the mediterranean, with small regional variations.

The fire spewed nearly four times the [carbon emissions](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/food-swaps-carbon-emissions-study/) as airplanes do in a year, study authors said. It's about the same amount of carbon dioxide that 647 million cars put in the air in a year, based on [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data.](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=typical%20passenger%20vehicle%3F-,A%20typical%20passenger%20vehicle%20emits%20about%204.6%20metric%20tons%20of,8%2C887%20grams%20of%20CO2)>>

The article says the land area burned was 29.951 square miles, ""six times more than the average from 2001 to 2022"" and more than the land area of West Virginia.

This land area burned by the 2023 Canadian wildfires is much less than reported last year.  E.g., NASA reported the 2023 Canadian wildfires  ""burned an estimated [18.4 million hectares](https://ciffc.net/) \[more than 71 million square miles\] —an area roughly the size of North Dakota. On average, just 2.5 million hectares burn in Canada each year.""  This higher reported land area burned would equal the land area of New York and West Virginia combined.

1dkogsi,Choosing a 'forever home' in the face of climate change: Avoiding snow vs avoiding heat?,"I'm considering moving to my 'retirement' destination in about 5 years.  I was thinking over where I might choose to retire.  While I have other considerations that wouldn't be relevant to this sub, I have a few in conflict that maybe this sub can help me resolve.

1.  I'd like somewhere that *doesn't* get a lot of snow and ice.  I have cerebral palsy and I will probably *have* to use a crutch, walker or maybe even a wheelchair by my mid 60's (~ 2050).  Even today I don't do well with icy sidewalks.
2.  I'd like somewhere that won't get too hot in the summer time.  Yes I know this is in conflict with \#1.
3.  I'd like somewhere that'll have a stable water supply and isn't prone to major drought.
4.  I'd like somewhere that's *not* prone to a major disaster (earth quakes, hurricanes, rampant wildfire, etc)

I know what you're thinking: 1. PNW! 2.PNW! 3. PNW? 4. NOT PNW!

When [I read things](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one) like:
>Kenneth Murphy, who directs FEMA’s Region X, the division responsible for Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, says, “Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.”

Let's just say dying to a cascadia megaquake isn't on my bucket list.

I've been looking at [this map](https://i.redd.it/uc52j9cgrfc51.jpg) of us snowfall.  I expect that snowfall to shift northward with global warming, but the question is *how much*?  I know current estimates put us at warming by 2.1C by 2050, but we're already ~ 1.1C over baseline so really that's only another 1C of warming, warming is 2x over land so we're back to 2C effective warming.  I've been playing around with [this map](https://impactlab.org/map/#usmeas=absolute&usyear=2040-2059&gmeas=absolute&gyear=1986-2005&usrcp=ssp245&usvar=tasmin&usprob=0.5)

Don't think for a minute I'm minimizing the danger of climate change overall, but that doesn't shift days well below freezing by as much as I thought it would.  I question how much northward the 'rare snow' line moves?  I'd love to hear arguments against though!

My overall point is that unfortunately the PNW is off the table, and given the sheer amount of snowfall the great lakes region receives I think that's off the table too.  I'm considering eastern TN, maybe Chattanooga due to the above as well as it's fast internet and low taxes.  Where would you move in the US if you were me?

At the time of their reporting, the Cow Valley Fire, the Larch Creek Fire, and the Salt Creek Fire were all burning with a combined area of over 100,000 acres. Other smaller fires had also been cropping up around the state.

The state of emergency allows the offices responding to the fires to ""utilize personnel and equipment from all state agencies necessary to prevent, fight, and recover from wildfires,"" the Statesman explained....

Part of the reason for this is that, with the rise of [global temperatures](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101), more plant matter — such as tall grasses and fallen trees — dries up and effectively turns into kindling. Hot winds also carry heat and [spread fire more easily. ](https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection#:~:text=Research%20shows%20that%20changes%20in,fuels%20during%20the%20fire%20season.)

1cjl1v4,Climate change is perhaps the biggest factor in bumblebee decline,"<< Bumblebee populations have declined by 90 percent in the past 20 years, according to Environment America. There are many different factors contributing to their decline, including the use of pesticides and urban development. However, climate change is perhaps the biggest factor....

 And now, a new *Frontiers in Bee Science* study has found that the rising heat caused by global warming might be a reason for the decrease in numbers across the globe.

""The decline in populations and ranges of several species of bumblebees may be explained by issues of overheating of the nests and the brood,"" Peter Kevan of the University of Guelph in Canada and lead author of the study said in a statement. ""The constraints on the survival of the bumblebee brood indicate that heat is likely a major factor, with heating of the nest above about 35 degrees Celsius being lethal, despite the remarkable capacity of bumblebees to thermoregulate."">>

17r8ioa,Can we please stop the anecdotal evidence?,"This is posted on both r/climatechange and r/climateskeptics, because I see it in abundance on both subs. Anecdotes are irrelevant when making an argument for or against climate change. Climate change is a global phenomenon, although it can lead to local variability. But at least, the anecdotes need to be contextualized. What are the larger trends? If your observation goes against that trend, then it is just an anomaly. If you bring it up as an example of that trend, then refer to the evidence of that trend. 

In other words, if you want to post about the flood in Pakistan (typical for the r/climatechange sub), then show that it is part of a statistically significant increasing trend of floods likely caused by climate change. Otherwise, what is your point? That floods did not occur before we released CO2 in the atmosphere? 

If you want to discuss the unusually cold summer in your Norwegian home town (typical for the r/climateskeptics sub), what is your point? Global warming is not defined by a small specific location. Anomalies are found everywhere, all the time, because the world is large and complex and full of variability. 

Consider the empirical data at the global scale. Splitting it into different regions is fine, but don't lose sight of the larger trends. Considering hurricane trends for the North Atlantic is fine but what about the other regions and what about the global total?

>... We know subtle changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the past ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity.  
           
>The Sun doesn’t always shine at perpetually the same level of brightness; it brightens and dims slightly, taking 11 years to complete one solar cycle. During each cycle, the Sun undergoes various changes in its activity and appearance. Levels of solar radiation go up or down, as does the amount of material the Sun ejects into space and the size and number of [sunspots and solar flares](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/en/ ""https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/en/""). These changes have a variety of effects in space, in Earth’s atmosphere and on Earth’s surface.  
          
>The current solar cycle (Solar Cycle 25) began in December 2019 and has quickly ramped up in activity. Although the Sun won’t reach peak levels until 2025, it is already exceeding early predictions. NASA’s upcoming [Geospace Dynamics Constellation Mission](https://lws.larc.nasa.gov/gdc/ ""https://lws.larc.nasa.gov/gdc/""),  currently scheduled to launch in 2027, will provide valuable insights into Solar Cycle 26.  
        
>According to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the current scientific consensus is that long and short-term variations in solar activity play only a very small role in Earth’s climate. Warming from increased levels of human-produced greenhouse gases is actually many times stronger than any effects due to recent variations in solar activity.   
        
>For more than 40 years, satellites have observed the Sun's energy output, which has gone up or down by less than 0.1 percent during that period. Since 1750, the warming driven by greenhouse gases coming from the human burning of fossil fuels is over 270 times greater than the slight extra warming coming from the Sun itself over that same time interval.  
          
>[NASA graph: Temperature vs Solar Activity, 1880-2019]      
         
>As mentioned, the Sun is currently experiencing a low level of sunspot activity. Some scientists speculate that this may be the beginning of a periodic solar event called a “grand minimum,” while others say there is insufficient evidence to support that position. During a grand minimum, solar magnetism diminishes, sunspots appear infrequently and less ultraviolet radiation reaches Earth. Grand minimums can last several decades to centuries. The largest recent event happened during the “Little Ice Age” (13th to mid-19th century): the “Maunder Minimum,” an extended period of time between 1645 and 1715, when there were few sunspots.   
    
>Several studies in recent years have looked at the effects that another grand minimum might have on global surface temperatures. These studies have suggested that while a grand minimum might cool the planet as much as 0.3 degrees C, this would, at best, slow down (but not reverse) human-caused global warming. There would be a small decline of energy reaching Earth, and just three years of current carbon dioxide concentration growth would make up for it. In addition, the grand minimum would be modest and temporary, with global temperatures quickly rebounding once the event concluded.  
    
>Some people have linked the Maunder Minimum’s temporary cooling effect to decreased solar activity, but that change was more likely influenced by increased volcanic activity and ocean circulation shifts.   
     
>Moreover, even a prolonged “Grand Solar Minimum” or “Maunder Minimum” would only briefly and minimally offset human-caused warming.

12mdrqs,Why are they shutting down nuclear reactors in Germany?,"I just want to understand, my reasons have nothing to do with politics or denial. Please hear me out.

Maybe I'm just not informed well enough, but I'm really confused why the German Green party has been advertising the shutdown of all nuclear power plants since the 90s. Now they're all being shut down. 

Meanwhile, the coal-fired power plants are aimed to be shut down in 2038.

I believe, although I'm no expert, that the CO2 problem is waaay bigger than the nuclear waste problem. The global warming limit of 1.5°C will very likely be reached within the next decades. Nuclear waste shouldn't be a problem, because you can store it underground without any long-term effects (this is technically not true, but I have faith that in at least a hundred years, when it might become a problem, we will have the technology to shoot it into the sun or do something else with it). 
So the only problem I see is the mining process, but cpmpared to coal mines - just the mines, not the burning - I believe that is a price worth paying.

So why does no one shut down coal-fired power plants and coal mines, but instead shut down a valuable source of energy that can get us across the gap to climate-friendly energy sources?

I'm not saying that nuclear energy is a good source of energy long-term. But for now, I think it's better than coal.

Please tell me what I'm missing here. If this decision is in fact a good one, then I'll be glad to be corrected.",1681507042.0,78,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/12mdrqs/why_are_they_shutting_down_nuclear_reactors_in/,global warming,Positive
pwydag,"""rain in the arctic"" is akin to ""a snowball's chance in hell"" (...yet it just happened)","a few weeks ago there was an NPR story about why people have difficulty understanding why scientists are concerned about climate change,... the problem is too much use of *""Climate Jargon""* which people don't understand

[https://www.npr.org/2021/09/08/1033362163/enough-with-the-climate-jargon-scientists-aim-for-clearer-messages-on-global-war](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/08/1033362163/enough-with-the-climate-jargon-scientists-aim-for-clearer-messages-on-global-war)

sigh,... I'm not a climate scientist but I do have a degree in physics so thought I'd illustrate why man made climate change is a very big problem

simple truth is,... too few recognize the dangers of burning various hydrocarbon fuels like: coal, methane, gas, diesel, etc. 

basically burning stuff releases a greenhouse gas, that accumulates in the atmosphere

FYI a greenhouse gas (like CO2) traps infrared energy (which is why the planet is warming up)

[basically the chemical combustion process creates CO2 which is a greenhouse gas that accumulate in the atmosphere](https://preview.redd.it/ry6cffzlg5q71.png?width=1875&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0588456decdf93fe6806f7302b2e5660f56efa)

&#x200B;

[since people all together burn about a 100 million barrels of oil a day \(AND since there are 42 gals in a barrel of oil\),... to measure the vast amounts of CO2 being put into the atmosphere, scientists use the unit measurement of a \\""gigaton\\"" \(which is the weight of a cubic kilometer of water\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ohzoosnpg5q71.png?width=1875&format=png&auto=webp&s=68928d4ad0e6b5f8a4d01a4f7a078853dc320f51)

to grasp why man made climate change is a problem, ponder for a moment the first reported rain fall (on top of a mountain of ice) in the arctic region

since man made climate change skeptics use religion (in the debate) figure explaining the science in religious terms might get the message across 

[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2012/08/skeptical-uses-of-religion-in-debate-on-climate-change/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2012/08/skeptical-uses-of-religion-in-debate-on-climate-change/)

consider science tells us,... **the arctic region since the time of Jesus, has been frozen solid**

yet looking at the news and science journals we see a warming trend AND **now there is rain falling in the arctic region**

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/08/19/greenland-melt-august-summit-rain/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/08/19/greenland-melt-august-summit-rain/)

...just a wild guess but the shock and awe of scientists who first noticed rain falling on top of a mountain in the arctic circle,... is akin to the shock and awe of Moses who came upon a burning bush on top of a mountain

anyway if trends continue and the Greenland ice cap melts,... **science indicates there will be a global flood sorta like as described in story of Noah**

![img](d0srf7i6g5q71 ""looking at the long term orbital dynamics (IOW what is the path the earth takes over geological time) is revealing,... at the present moment, science indicates the earth is ever so gradually moving away from the sun,... when the earth is further away from the sun, we expect the planet to ever so slightly cool down,... and yet scientists just observed rainfall in the arctic on top of a mountain of ice (which indicates the planet is warming up)

o90gp0,What it's like to live with a +3.5°C warming,"Hello, fellas. My name is Lucas, I live in a region in Brazil that, according to NOAA, has warmed a little more than 3.5°C on average since 1960 until 2020.
It's funny how here nobody denies global warming, the only deniers I ever met were online and once a professor here obviously being paid to miseducate scholars (shock: back in 2019!) but that's because the whole government policy in Brazil right now is of denial and anti-environmentalism. Imagine our president to be Trump on steroids and without a leash.
Well, anyways, one of the reasons I usually sob about, is how in my early 20s me and my friends could already tell there's been a significant warming from what we remember in our lives already. But growing up here all I heard from adults was how much hotter and drier everything was and the elderly had even more stories that today sounds like fairy tale.
From my childhood until today (I'm 26), the climate in the city I live in, went from being classified as highland tropical (Cwb) and is now tropical (Aw).
The climate here is a monsoon-like type of climate: during summer, the Amazon humidity makes an U-Turn by the Andes slopes and towards South/Southeastern Brazil, with one the peaks of rainfall being where I live: November 290mm (11.4in); December 360mm (14in); January 320mm (12.6in); with a smooth transition to dry season -peaking in August (also winter/cool season). Summers were mildly warm from the extra humidity combined with the elevation of 850m on average, where I live it's more around 930m and the higher neighborhoods here reach 1200m. Winters were cool and dry but varying from year to year specially due to El Niño/neutrality/La Niña (pacific water temperatures) strong influence on this region's climate patterns.
Well it was a sort of inversed Mediterranean climate, with rainy summer and dry winter, the rainy summer making it never too hot and mild the whole year, a region known for its mildness although locals always felt hot in summer and cold in winter. It even frosted often times here past century, the last time being 1985 downtown at 3.5°C (38F) (idk why but in Brazil it can and will frost at anything below 4°C!!!). Today the lowest we get in the same region, which also grew in size and became a bigger heat island, is around 12°C (54F).
Phenomena like fog and very cold mornings (around 5°C/40F) completely vanished from my childhood and teens until today. The average air humidity which was rarely below 40% during dry season today is below 30% almost everyday and reaches extremely low values of around 12%. Then it comes October, the worst month of the year.
Until I was a teen, October was a smooth transition from dry to rainy weather: the slight and natural increase in humidity from the warming up atmosphere made it easier for cool humid air to reach us from Antarctica (during winter it's usually cool dry air) bringing the lowest highs of the year, around 14°C and 15°C (57-59F) and rainy afternoons a few times a month but also hot convection summer showers around 30°C (86F). This was a region known for not surpassing the 30°C(86F)  mark too many times a year, even tho the average high in the warmest month was 28°C (82F), we usually stay very close to our averages with less abrupt shifts like in higher lattitudes.  So then
Today's October is a HELL ON EARTH. There was a sudden shift 8-9 years ago, around 2012, when October's suddenly became very dry and hot! Kind of like the Pacific west coast's summer is today. The  all time high here kept at 36°C (97F) once in 110 years of measurement, last year we were 36°C in September for a week and then again in October for about 10 days. Many Brazilian cities shattered their all time highs by 4 to 6°C and kept repeating those highs for many days in a row. It was insane.
It's been somewhat like that every October since 2012 or so, never again it was mild.
Winters used to bring, on the coolest days, sunny afternoons with highs between 15°C(59F) and 20°C(68F), lows between 5°C(40F) and 10°C(50F), (in my lifetime) but now those are not even the coldest days in the year. Oh yeah, from a place used not to getting above 30°C (86F) a lot, our ""monsoon"" became weaker which meant more sunny days during summer and now being above 30°C everyday in summer is the rule.
Brace yourselves! What I observed from this insanity in climate change, specially warming and drying here, shows me that there was a tipping point: when new scandalous weather patterns suddenly appeared -after showing slow signs during the past decades- and came to stay. Here we are just adapting to feeling hot most of the year, it's quite an abrupt feeling for those who were once spoiled by very mild weather, older houses here even have chymneys and everything was built to let more sun indoors, now everyone hates the sun we want to hide in the shade.

x1poql,Started a geology class - teacher denies global warming?,"I'm in a 100 level course for geology with a teacher who has 4 degrees including a doctorate - I believe her doctorate paper was hypothesizing that yellowstone was increasing in activity.

So I hold what she says in high regard and want to trust what she says but a few things in class today really threw a curveball. Started with me telling her about Nasa's artemis program and the scrubbed launch she somehow got onto talking about the space force and secret technology's they must have since their job is to protect us from outside threats or threats from space [I'm fairly sure she was meaning alien life?] I know this post sounds like a wild troll I'm still a bit baffled myself but she continued saying she had once dated a rocket scientist who worked for the government and his role was reverse engineering crashed ships. I tried to assume she meant like reverse engineering technology from other countries we're competing with but she re-affirmed that she was talking about ET life. Again another major curveball that she believed these things. Im not denying the possibility of life in the universe more denying the likelyhood that intelligent life has ever visited us especially on an intimate level like that.

Anyway segway into climate change. She was giving us a lecture about the 4 spheres of the earth bio,hydro,atmo,geo. All extremely newbie information everyone should already be familiar with - half lifes of radioactive substances.

She started to go into the earths temperature and how its regulated and we looked at the range of co2 scientists believe to be a healthy range of 300-400 ppm and then had us look up the current ppm which was 414. A bit of an odd set of questions came from other students but she claimed that we're often taught that this co2 level is causing global temperatures to rise but then herself pointed back to the co2 range scientists think is a healthy zone and goes on to tell us that we are in the healthy zone as the earth has natural functions to balance out co2 content. Its hard to pull direct quotes but then infers that attempts to lower co2 emmissions and to pull co2 out of the air would be harmful because we would be pulling the world co2 ppm count away from the healthy range which could then lower temperatures and harm us??? idk it was a very odd experience and I felt like walking out and having an advisor swap me out of the class. She claims we are leaving an iceage and orbit close to the earth which is causes the ice to melt away but in the next 15,000 years when earths orbit shifts again everything will fall back into a new iceage. That to me was odd like if we are leaving the iceage now and co2 is rising since the industrial revolution why wouldnt it get absurdely hot. She did continue to say that when the earth is colder there is more co2 and when its warmer there is less. which made no fucking sense I hope she just had it backwards. From what I understand of the cycle as the earth warms up more co2 is released until the point in a cycle change where then the co2 acts more like a blanket which makes temperatures drop even lower with the more co2 in the air until its absorbed back into the oceans and earth over time where it would drop rather low.

I know she was speaking about Milankovitch Cycles but i dont understand why she doesnt attribute that co2 levels and temperature levels have deviated from the cycle post industrial revolution? Of course there have been a series of natural events to raise and lower temps by so much in living history but nothing like the sudden spike of co2 post industrial revolution? Idk im sure theres alot more to say from what I heard today and I know this wasnt all to clear. Even the NASA website somewhat agrees with the opposite of what she was saying. she reminded me of my dad in the way of denying human co2 could possibly overwhelm natures way of converting it to oxygen or absorbing it.

Arctic permafrost stores nearly 1,700 billion metric tons of frozen and thawing carbon. Anthropogenic warming threatens to release an unknown quantity of this carbon to the atmosphere. It is becoming increasingly clear that abrupt thaw processes, such as thermokarst and thermoerosion, could expose many metres of permafrost carbon to mobilization on the timescale of days to a few years.Abrupt thaw can be triggered by climate warming or landscape disturbances, including wildfires or hydrological regime changes. In turn, abrupt thaw causes thermal, hydrological and vegetation changes that amplify warming and thaw. **Earth system models must include permafrost dynamics to enable accurate permafrost carbon feedback projections.** [https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10313977](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10313977)

Colleagues and I have just published research showing more of this methane hydrate is vulnerable to warming than previously thought. This is a worry as that hydrate contains about as much carbon as all of the remaining oil and gas on Earth. Releasing it from the seabed could cause the oceans to become more acidic and the climate to warm further. This is a dangerous set of circumstances. The massive venting of methane from similar ancient marine hydrate reservoirs has been linked to some of the severest and most rapid climate changes in the Earth's history.

oglyeq,Opinion on having kids during the era of climate change,"Currently in my 20s and have wanted kids for some time but with the events over the years, I feel like I will be bringing them into a world that isn't going down a safe path. I know there is still time to change our current trajectory (reducing carbon emissions etc) but right now it seems like a stretch.

So my question is, is it right to procreate knowing that the world may not be a safe place to live in within the next 50-60 years? Is it worth to bring children into this life and hope that they can ""contribute to form a better society"" or somehow help the issue of climate change?",1625796919.0,90,175,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/oglyeq/opinion_on_having_kids_during_the_era_of_climate/,carbon emissions,Positive
18mamx4,Why not Nuclear?,"With all of the panic circulating in the news about man-made climate change, specifically our outsized carbon footprint, why are more people not getting behind nuclear energy? It seems to me, most of the solutions for reducing emissions center around wind and solar energy, both of which are terrible for the environment and devastate natural ecosystems. I can only see two reasons for the reluctance:

1. People are still afraid of nuclear energy, and do not want the “risks” associated with it.

2. Policymakers are making too much money pushing wind and solar, so they don’t want a shift into nuclear. 

Am I missing something here? If we are in such a dire situation, why are the climate activists not actively pushing the most viable and clean replacement to fossil fuels? Why do they insist on pushing civilization backward by using unreliable unsustainable forms of energy?",1703015197.0,87,374,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/18mamx4/why_not_nuclear/,carbon emissions,Negative
psts0l,The IPCC Report says it's still possible to stay below a 2 degree temperature rise,"The recent IPCC climate change report was based on 14,000 scientific papers and in full runs to nearly 4000 pages. It was a stark, detailed and credible warning of the choices ahead of us - over the next few years in particular - and the extremes of heat/wet/dry we’ll experience if we don’t act with intention and care as temperatures increase from the current 1C rise we're experiencing already.

https://preview.redd.it/qfgd337nmxo71.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=d257f060a09da874c45f259866c6a700a9496c8f

It also presents scenarios for us to get back to a sustainable and stabilized climate by reducing and removing CO2e emissions from now onwards. These scenarios are still possible, and cause for hope that we can limit and reverse some of the damage we’re already feeling the start of now.

If we want to stay somewhere between 1.5 - 2 degrees celsius increase we don’t have much additional CO2 we can add to the atmosphere. Roughly about 300–550 gigatonnes of carbon budget left globally to be in with a good shot of limiting heating (at present we emit about 50 gigatonnes a year).

https://preview.redd.it/1nxvr3bylxo71.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5651b824485c7a05275f122ee7597f4d6e9e6a

In these lower emissions scenarios (SSP1–1.9 and SSP1–2.6 in the report) which keep us around 2 degrees or less there isn’t a sustainable rate of emissions post net-zero, other than those that we also remove through nature-based and technology based carbon removal initiatives. Also, it also assumes we start reducing annual emissions significantly from now onwards.

At present international pledges and commitments don't put us on a trajectory for either lower temperature increases scenario, though there's hope that we can get closer. We're presently on track to be somewhere between the intermediate (with a best estimate of a 2.7 degree increase) and high (best estimate about 3.6 degree increase) scenarios.

Fortunately the science says we're no longer on the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) track with a best estimate of 4.4 degree increase, which shows we can make progress, albeit not as fast as would be ideal so far.

18pmyfx,Good News in 2023,"**The greatest year ever for clean energy**

Thanks to the staggering uptake of wind and solar, energy researchers had to tear up all their old forecasts, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), which announced in October that global fossil fuel use may peak this year, two years earlier than predicted just 12 months ago. More than 120 countries, including the world's two largest carbon emitters, China and the United States, also agreed to aim to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency by 2030 - a target that if met, would keep the world on track for 1.5°C.

&#x200B;

**Solar installations changed our climate future**

Humanity will install an astonishing 413 GW of solar this year, 58% more than in 2022, which itself marked an almost 42% increase from 2021. That means the world's solar capacity has doubled in the last 18 months, and that solar is now the fastest-growing energy technology in history. In September, the IEA announced that solar photovoltaic installations are now ahead of the trajectory required to reach net zero by 2050, and that if solar maintains this kind of growth, it will become the world's dominant source of energy before the end of this decade.

&#x200B;

**China's carbon emissions are likely to start falling next year**

This, and not COP28, was the most important climate change story of the year, because China is the world's largest carbon polluter, and was supposed to still be six years away from peak emissions. The reason for this epochal shift? The country's unprecedented buildout of 300 GW of solar and wind in 2023, almost double its 2022 total. It's the largest ever single year deployment of energy in our species' history. “There’s nothing you can benchmark this against.""

&#x200B;

**A green manufacturing boom in America**

The Inflation Reduction Act is the single largest commitment any government has yet made to vie for leadership in the next energy economy, and has resulted in the largest manufacturing drive in the United States since WW2. The legislation has already yielded commitments of more than $300 billion in new battery, solar and hydrogen electrolyzer plants, with Georgia, Michigan, Texas, Tennessee and Kentucky in the lead. This year a record 33 GW of solar was installed across the country, carbon emissions are set to fall by around 3%, Texas is undergoing the fastest pace of clean energy expansion anywhere in the world outside China, California's battery storage capacity has surged tenfold in just three years, and 12 states have now passed laws requiring a shift to 100% clean electricity.

&#x200B;

**Europe knocked years off its decarbonisation timeline**

Coal generation in Europe plummeted in 2023, leading to fossil fuels' share of electricity generation falling to a record low of 17% in the first half of the year, while solar installations increased by 40% for the third year in a row. The continent has also managed to kick its addiction to putler's ruZZian fossil fuels, phasing out coal imports, reducing oil imports by 90% and reducing fossil gas imports from 155 billion cubic meters in 2021 to an estimated 45 billion cubic meters in 2023.

&#x200B;

**The clean energy revolution ramped up in many countries**

Rooftop solar overtook coal as Australia's biggest source of electricity capacity, the Philippines saw explosive growth in offshore wind, South Africa's rooftop solar sector became the fastest growing in the world, Canada became the second-most attractive place in the world for renewables developers (after the United States), Brazil invested billions into grid transmission, the United Kingdom reported that carbon emissions have fallen by more than two-thirds in a decade, and Vietnam finalised its Just Transition agreement, including no new coal, which is great news for the planet, because it has the world's third largest coal pipeline. 

&#x200B;

**No signs of an electric vehicle slowdown**

Global electric vehicle sales increased by 36% this year, bringing the world's total to 41 million electric vehicles. The shift is remarkable: just two years ago, one in 25 cars sold globally was an electric vehicle. This year it will be one in five, and by 2025, one in two. The IEA now says that electric vehicle sales, like solar installations, are tracking ahead of its net zero scenarios. In the United States, where the media spent much of the year insisting there's been a slowdown, sales were up 50%, and growth in China was even more explosive; two in every five new cars sold was electric, and gasoline demand peaked two years earlier than expected.

Hey folks,

we are Jiddu and Alex, and we are building a modern and easy to use tracker (dashboard) for climate change.

There are many excellent data sources on climate science, like the IPCC, NOAA, NASA, Berkeley Earth and Global Carbon Project. However, we believe there is not a place where they are combined in an easy to understand tool.

We aim to provide such a place and a tool that gives an up to date overview of climate change in a way that also supports an easy understanding.

We have started with widgets on global temperature and earth’s energy balance. Currently we are working to include topics like greenhouse gas emissions, extreme weather events, sea level changes, human engagement and more.

14z2q98,Why isn't it accepted that at least 3C of warming is 'baked' into current warming trajectory?,"I see a lot of redditors casually make the claim that 2C will be about as ""bad"" as warming gets.  Setting aside that it's the 'middle value' for the 'accepted' RPC pathway, why is there such confidence in this number?  I see it all over reddit, but I don't really get it.

The last time the earth had co2 400ppm, the climate was 2-3C hotter than preindustrial.

Right now we are at 424ppm and still climbing, probably because 2/3 of all electricity generation is hydrocarbon and 80% of all energy production is hydrocarbon (and i'm leaving out other forcing gasses i realize).   We have yet to achieve a single normal year where co2 emissions have decreased, which probably means we will almost certainly have hit 450ppm by 2035.

So for me the question is why isn't 3C of warming considered the baseline assumption?  Are assessments really that bullish on carbon capture?

**Ari Bernstein:** ""There are two things to understand about energy. The first comes from environmental science: We must reduce greenhouse gasses. It’s not enough to lower the emissions we spew in an already overburdened world. We need a negative carbon rate, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

And the second comes from economics: The best way to extend lifespan and improve social conditions is with cheap, reliable energy. Inexpensive heat in the winter has saved more lives than penicillin. Electricity has done more to improve the quality of life than anything since the discovery of fire.

In short, if you don’t work to remove carbon from the atmosphere, you are not serious about the environment. If you don’t seek reliable low-cost electricity, you are not serious about the poor.""

**David A. Schlissel**: ""No, carbon capture on its own cannot save us. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) created the threat from climate change that we face today. A fundamental transition away from fossil fuels to a renewable and sustainable energy economy is needed. Fortunately, that change is happening, although not as fast as we need.

I agree that some carbon capture hopefully will be part of this fundamental transition of the world’s energy economy. First, to capture and store the CO2 emitted during industrial processes. Second, to remove CO2 already in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels—a process called direct air capture or DAC.

The stated goal for carbon capture from coal plants is to capture 90% or more of the CO2 produced by the plant. However, there is no evidence that existing technologies actually can achieve this goal at commercial-scale plants over the long term, not merely on an intermittent basis. In fact, neither of the two existing coal-fired generators in the world that have been retrofitted for carbon capture has achieved a 90% CO2 capture rate, even for a few years.""",1600653600.0,73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/iwrbx7/david_a_schlissel_the_stated_goal_for_carbon/,carbon emissions,Positive
166lizu,Every Skeptics Argument on Climate Change and the science to disprove it,"Please  note that the arguments below lack strong scientific support and  have  been widely debunked by the scientific community. The prevailing   scientific consensus strongly indicates that human activities, including   fossil fuel burning like oil, significantly drive climate change. This   is extensively supported by global climate scientists.

Also,  Let's not forget Internal documents from ExxonMobil came to light,  revealing that the  company had information about climate change as  early as the 1970s even though they funded misinfo like seen below.  That's only one example , but i will save that for another post.

**Each Falsehood debunked**

1. **Natural Climate Variability**:  Some argue that the Earth's climate has undergone natural fluctuations  throughout its history, including periods of warming and cooling, long  before human industrial activity. While it's true that natural  variability exists, the rapid and unprecedented increase in greenhouse  gas concentrations since the industrial revolution aligns closely with  the observed rise in global temperatures.
2. **Solar Activity**:  Skeptics sometimes point to variations in solar radiation as a  potential driver of recent climate change. However, scientific research  has shown that solar activity has not increased significantly in recent  decades, and its contribution to the observed temperature rise is  minimal compared to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.
3. **Urban Heat Island Effect**:  Skeptics might claim that urbanization and the heat generated by cities  are responsible for the observed warming, rather than greenhouse gas  emissions. While urban heat islands can influence local temperatures,  they are not the primary driver of global temperature trends, and  climate models take their effects into account.
4. **Incomplete Historical Data**:  Some skeptics argue that the historical temperature data is incomplete  or unreliable, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions about  human-caused climate change. However, extensive efforts have been made  to address data quality issues, and multiple independent datasets  corroborate the warming trend.
5. **Natural Carbon Emissions**:  Certain individuals may suggest that natural sources of carbon dioxide,  such as volcanic activity, release far more greenhouse gases than human  activities. While volcanic emissions are significant, they are much  smaller than human-caused emissions and do not explain the recent rapid  increase in carbon dioxide levels.
6. **Climate Models' Limitations**:  Skeptics often highlight the uncertainties associated with climate  models to cast doubt on the accuracy of their predictions. While models  have uncertainties, they have consistently projected the observed  warming when accounting for a range of factors, including human  emissions.

The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and numerous scientific  organizations worldwide have concluded that human activities,  especially the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary drivers of the  rapid and unprecedented changes in the Earth's climate. Addressing  climate change is a global challenge that requires collective efforts to  transition to more sustainable energy sources and mitigate its impacts.

**But wait, Co2 is good for plants, right?**

Elevated  CO2 levels from human activities potentially benefiting plants  oversimplify complex ecosystem interactions and disregard negative  outcomes:

* **Diminishing Returns**: Initial benefits decline as other factors like nutrients, water, and temperature limit plant growth.
* **Imbalance in Ecosystems**: Rapid CO2 increases disrupt species balance, altering ecosystems and stability.
* **Nutritional Impact**: CO2 alters plant nutrition, affecting herbivores and omnivores that rely on them.
* **Heat Stress**: CO2-related temperature increases harm plants, negating positive effects.
* **Ocean Acidification**: Excess CO2 causes ocean acidification, threatening marine ecosystems.
* **Extreme Weather**: CO2-driven climate change intensifies hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, impacting plant life.
* **Pollination Disruption**: Climate change disrupts pollination, hurting plant reproduction and crops.
* **Biodiversity Loss**: CO2-linked disruptions lead to habitat loss, jeopardizing biodiversity.
* **Long-Term Consequences**: Unchecked CO2 emissions risk ecosystems, biodiversity, and human well-being.

From the Comments: ""**Greenland melted 400,000 years ago and had nothing to do with CO2""**

Certainly, let's address your concerns and provide some insights on why climate change is a real and pressing issue:

1. **Greenland's Historical Melting**: The natural climate variability that caused Greenland's melting 400,000 years ago isn't mutually exclusive with our current understanding of climate change. Today's situation involves a combination of factors, with human-caused greenhouse gas emissions being a significant contributor. CO2 levels have varied in the past, but the rapid increase since the industrial revolution is driving current changes.
2. **Ice Core Data and Boreholes**: Science is an evolving field, and advancements like the correction in the ice core method showcase its self-correcting nature. The consensus remains that human activities are causing current climate changes. Borehole measurements complement existing data, adding to our understanding of past climates.
3. **Climate Models and Predictions**: While there are various climate models, they consistently show warming trends linked to increased CO2 levels. NOTE: Media using RCP 8.5 might highlight a worst-case scenario to emphasize the urgent need for action. The broader consensus across models supports the reality of climate change.
4. **IPCC and Future Projections**: The IPCC's projections provide a range to account for uncertainties. While error margins exist, the consistent trend of warming and its impacts on ecosystems and species cannot be ignored. Making informed decisions based on the best available data remains crucial for our future well-being.

From the comments: ""**Less CO2 in the air means so much oxygen that we will die!** ""

While climate change and oxygen levels are separate issues, it's  important to clarify that the current atmospheric oxygen level is not a  concern for human health. Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of  nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), along with trace amounts of  other gases.",1693512520.0,72,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/166lizu/every_skeptics_argument_on_climate_change_and_the/,carbon emissions,Positive

I really want clarity towards how should i treat my assets, income and behavior in the wake of our current predicament. I keep reading sources, and articles, books, et cetera. It seems even in the best case scenario, our life in the next several decades will undergo a drastic changes, that will directly affect individuals, and especially the value of money.

i really don't know. i was promised that hard work will bear fruit, there is a saying in my country that means basically this: ""if you work hard, you will enjoy the fruits of your labor later"" assuming there is a future to be had. 

i am in my mid 20's and while it is true, i always feel it is within my capabilities if i work my ass now, i can slowly build my wealth and assets and enjoy a comfy retirement. with the threats climate change pose now, i don't feel it is worth trading my present for a future that is uncertain at best, and non-existent at worst. what do i do with all these money in the future, if say 40 years from now money is basically dirt? why should i just spend my income on frivolous things, only have minimum emergency savings, dont bother to invest long term, etc? 

assuming money is like time, would you invest your money on a shipping company whose ships are full of holes? no. i just feel like ""meh, just enjoy your life, buy whatever you want because it might not last"" and it can be nerve wracking. the expectations of life i was taught as a child is really shattered. i really wonder do i even want to seriously build a family in an uncertain world like this? thinking about our uncertain future? i am confused because no matter how i see it, even in the best case scenario, society will undergo drastic changes and most things we consider valuable will be worthless and i might not be able to enjoy the stuff i have been holding out for 'retirement'  because it might not be possible at all. 


the attitude might be not so bad, but sometimes the pressure of 'normalcy' is crushing. almost all people i know in life acts like there is no problem, and society will go towards the course it have been since WW II, aka optimistic progress and abundance of wealth and stability. i would love to be wrong, but i feel like they are ignorant, and in their ignorance, judge me. they will think i am crazy, lazy or stupid for thinking the way i am now. it is just frustrating. i am frustrated and really don't know how to act properly. the peak of my frustrations are when i read the article where celebrity climate change advocate are attending summit with their fuel guzzling private jets. while i work hard, while also giving up some life's conveniences to help the planet, this bastards live using more carbon in a day of their lives than i use in a year, and still have the gall to say publicly ""mm okay guys, let's save our planet by working together, save energy blah blah blah"" while they wear $10000 suit that in manufacturing alone cost more than my carbon emission in a year of my daily life.

1aesoan,"China has a new climate & environment strategy ""Beautiful China"". Here's what is planned","Taken von Carbon Brief's China Briefing of 25 January 2024: [https://www.carbonbrief.org/china-briefing-25-january-clean-energy-drives-growth-beautiful-china-instructions-interview-with-efcs-prof-zou-ji/](https://www.carbonbrief.org/china-briefing-25-january-clean-energy-drives-growth-beautiful-china-instructions-interview-with-efcs-prof-zou-ji/) 

I found it so interesting and ambitious that I wanted to share it here. Seeing China taking climate and environmental issues seriously gives me hope that the country will push for high global environmental standards.

### 

### Tasks, measures and timelines for ‘Beautiful China’

**BEAUTIFUL CHINA:** The top bodies of the Chinese  government and governing Communist party – the state council and the  central committee, respectively – issued the full text of new  instructions on “comprehensively promoting the construction of a  Beautiful China” in a 27 December official release, published by state  news agency [Xinhua](http://www.news.cn/politics/20240111/b1e10e998f644683b7e64d8bf8ff589b/c.html)  on 11 January. The Beautiful China initiative is a “top-level  development blueprint detailing specific targets for…the nation’s green  and high-quality growth”, another [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240111/7c1eac3e23d14552a110a1a47c063244/c.html) report explained. [ClientEarth](https://www.clientearth.org/)’s Dimitri De Boer wrote in [China Dialogue](https://chinadialogue.net/en/climate/10235-opinion-what-does-xi-s-thought-mean-for-the-environment/) that the initiative “ties a good environment to a sense of national pride”.

**KEY GOALS:** The document outlined a slew of tasks,  measures and timelines within China’s overall push to peak its carbon  emissions before 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. By 2027,  “green and low-carbon development” will be “further promoted”, it said.  By 2035, “green production methods and lifestyles will be widely  formed”. By the middle of the century, “ecological civilisation will be  comprehensively upgraded…\[with\] deep decarbonisation achieved in key  areas”. Goals listed in the document include: the country will compile  an annual national greenhouse gas inventory; “gradually shift” to “[dual control” of carbon emissions](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-china/#dual-control); protect more than 3.15m square kilometres of land from being eligible for development projects under the national ecological “[red line](https://chinadialogue.net/en/digest/china-publishes-first-blue-book-on-ecological-redlines/)”  policy; ensure China’s cities become “waste-free” by 2035; and see new  energy vehicles (NEVs, mostly electric vehicles) comprise around 45% of  new cars by 2027.  

**OFFICIAL COMMENT:** The document was passed in a  meeting chaired by Chinese president Xi Jinping, who said that “building  a Beautiful China is an important goal for building a modern socialist  country”, the state-run [China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202311/09/WS654c2c48a31090682a5ed36b.html)  reported – giving the document more weight and signalling to officials  that China’s carbon-neutrality goals remain an important target. Adding  to the momentum, following its publication, Sun Jinlong and Huang Runqiu  – the Communist party secretary and the minister at the ministry of  ecology and environment (MEE), respectively – wrote an opinion piece in  the Communist party-backed newspaper [People’s Daily](http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2024/0116/c1001-40159652.html)  saying that the document “clearly defines the overall requirements, key  tasks and major initiatives” guiding the Beautiful China initiative. In  an interview with [Xinhua](https://www.gov.cn/zhengce/202401/content_6925525.htm),  a senior official of the MEE said incentives and policy measures could  “mobilise enthusiasm, initiative and creativity” to build a Beautiful  China.",1706632650.0,60,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1aesoan/china_has_a_new_climate_environment_strategy/,carbon emissions,Positive
sy3z6o,Why fighting climate change has to be a many-pronged effort.,"Rather than debate one single approach to combating the climate crisis vs. another, it's important to take a big-picture approach.  If you haven't read [Project Drawdown](https://drawdown.org/drawdown-framework), do so!

In that spirit, I want to volunteer what I see as indispensable planks for a livable, regenerative future.  We need to regenerate ecosystems to be healthy carbon sinks.  This has to be from the foundations of the food web on up, from soil microbes and algae on up.


* Bio-active soil amendments, like Amazonian [Terra Preta](http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html) and other biochar soil amendments around the world.  These consist of charred biomass and compost, inoculated with nutrients microbes that establish and propogate themselves.  Terra Preta has been known to grow a centimeter a year in the Amazon, absorbing carbon and sequestering it in its mass while building fertility.


* Closed-loop algae farms.  This is one of the easiest things to [do at home](https://www.wikihow.com/Grow-Spirulina-at-Home), and if you get it right, your most low-footprint [food source](https://wiki.lowtechlab.org/wiki/Culture_de_la_spiruline/en).  It will improve your air quality, regardless.  And yes, it does [scale up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAdrNQNP8ew) to industrial levels.  Its value as a carbon sink and potential fertilizer for crops is not to be ignored.


* [Accelerated forest regeneration](https://www.wri.org/insights/what-assisted-natural-regeneration-benefits-definition).  By mimicking and aiding the phases of growth of natural forests from ponds and meadows to early growth to maturity, we can get bio-diverse forests back in a fraction of the time that would be naturally required.


* Fixing [glitches in photosynthesis](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-boost-plant-production-by-40-percent-through-a-photosynthesis-shortcut).  Many of the plants adapted to arid conditions, as well as some of the fastest-growing trees, use C4 photosynthesis.  This is an alternative to C3 photosynthesis, which most lush greenery uses.  Turns out, C4 photosynthesis [can be engineered in staple grains](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201112100856.htm), and C3 photosynthesis can catch up.


* Bacteria as a source of protein-rich food staples - [bacilliculture instead of agriculture](https://thebulletin.org/2022/02/would-you-eat-bacteria-to-help-reverse-climate-change/).


* Remodel our existing buildings to use more [passive energy](https://www.motherearthnews.com/green-homes/how-to-remodel-a-passive-solar-home-zb0z1305zhla) instead of actively heating and cooling forced air.


* Use better building materials.  Eight percent of our total emissions comes from producing portland cement.  Alternatives include solar-thermal kilns for [steel and cement](https://grist.org/article/this-company-wants-to-make-steel-and-cement-with-solar-power-heres-how/), [insulated rammed earth](https://sirewall.com/sirewall-system/), earthbags AKA [superadobe](http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/articles/bagmachine.htm), and natural materials like [cob](https://brightly.eco/cob-houses/).


* Finally, if we're to realize any gain from all of the above, we still have to [stop large-scale corporate polluters from burning the biosphere down for profit](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change).

mc91yw,Whats your opinion on nuclear power?,"In my opinion nuclear is a clear and valid option for fighting climate change. Without it, reducing carbon emissions will be much harder. The topic around nuclear technology has a reputation that was earned, and past reactors have had their fair share of problems. But despite that, nuclear power still ranks lowest on deaths per unit of energy produced. On the topic of waste, current reactors in the US can only use about 3% of the energy stored in the fuel before it must be removed and stored. 
New technologies and reactor designs have made reactors that are much much more efficient, which will lead to much less waste. Some of these reactors even operate at atmospheric pressure, so theres no chance of a pressure explosion from an accident. There are even fuels that have been made that actually physically cannot melt down.
All this sounds good, but none of it has been used. Most of the nuclear plants in the US are 30+ years old. This is largely due to the costs associated with building a new nuclear plant. Without a firm backing from climate organizations, the general public, or governments, energy companies don’t have much of a reason to invest in these new technologies.

Where do some of you stand on this topic? What are your concerns? Do you think this is something we should use to stall climate change?",1616600844.0,54,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/mc91yw/whats_your_opinion_on_nuclear_power/,carbon emissions,Negative
16vbwc8,Is planting trees a waste of time?,"I'm still learning about how we can tackle Climate Change, and I see a huge number of people stating they're 'Net Zero' or 'Carbon Neutral' because they planted some trees.

I've read numerous articles about how planting trees is great... but it'll take up to 100 years for them to mature before they start fully absorbing the CO2 that these companies market.

Here's that quote:

""A typical tree can absorb around 21 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, however this figure is only achieved when the tree is fully grown - saplings will absorb significantly less than this. Over a lifetime of 100 years, one tree could absorb around a tonne of CO2. While this seems like a significant amount, humans are creating about [40 billions tonnes of CO2](https://www.viessmann.co.uk/company/blog/the-carbon-footprint-of-nearly-everything) each year, meaning that we’d need to plant 40 billion trees annually to offset the emissions created. Even if this were possible, land space would be significantly reduced. "" - [Link to Article](https://www.viessmann.co.uk/en/heating-advice/boilers/how-much-co2-does-tree-absorb.html)

Considering the climate crisis is now and not in 100 years, should companies find an alternative method of offsetting/removing their emissions if they can't make them sustainable?

If so, what would those methods be?  


Edit:   
A lot of people talking just about how good or bad trees are.

Its a chemical.

Its properties as an energy vector are suboptimal at best; low efficiencies, hydrogen leakage/embrittlement etc. But it is still one of the most important chemicals on the planet, and I dont see why there is such a push back against decarbonising its production.

Its vital in agriculture, through the HB process, and agriculture accounts for roughly 10% of global CO2 emissions.

It can be used as a replacement for carbon in Steel production, another huge emitter of CO2 \~8% of emissions.

It can even be used to greatly reduce the CO2 used in the concrete industry, or even the production of rocket fuel.

Although climate change discussions tend to revolve around the energy sector, huge decarbonisation still needs to be carried out across all industries, and imo this is where green hydrogen really shines.",1730143085.0,48,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1geal2u/the_hate_for_hydrogen/,carbon emissions,Positive

So the argument presented was that a standard sized tree can absorb 21.77 kilograms of Carbon. If we counteract our Carbon production with appropriate number trees planted as per each country's carbon emission then we don't need to go green. So, for example, instead of cutting down trees to create solar farms, we should plant more trees.

pz40ny,"Carbon Capture, utilisation and Storage is a small tool for a big challenge","Somethings referred to as CCS, CCUS or CDR.

Carbon capture may be a small part of the solution to help bring the atmospheric ppm down from the 413 ppm of CO2 towards 350 ppm (roughly equivalent to what it was in the 1970s). After reaching 350ppm with CCS we’ll be able to decide how much closer to the pre-industrialisation level of 250ppm we’d like to go.

However, we’re a long way from that at present. We simply emit too much, about 50 gigatonnes (billion tonnes) in 2020.

Point Source Capture hasn’t made that much progress (it’s expensive and unproven). Direct Air Capture and storage in rocks underground will likely help eventually (according to the IPCC) but it’s not ready technologically to be able to scale to make a dent in removing the tens of gigatonnes of emissions humans release every year. It also uses a lot of energy which could be used for other things.

If CCS can get to about 5 GT capacity (currently [40 million tonnes/megatonnes](https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage)) over the next 30 years it will be a useful tool to help get closer to net zero and then negative. The cost of getting there is huge and it’d be a lot cheaper to stop emitting as much across all industries (lots we know how to do already, though we’ve not started doing it at scale, yet).

The best way - economically, systemically, scientifically - to get to net zero is to rapidly reduce our emissions - by half by 2030 to be on track - from everything we do. When that’s being achieved both nature-based and tech carbon capture and storage play roles, though aren’t magic bullets without large and permanent emissions reductions. While important to do in this *yes...and* scenario just focusing on CCS/anthropogenic CDR rather than mostly reduction is not treating the core problem that’s heating up the planet, and all the biosphere damage that’s doing.

To reach net zero we're going to need removal technologies (combined with protecting and investing in our nature based sinks). Both of the lower emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) in the recent [IPCC Climate Science report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) require negative emissions beyond reaching net zero. CCS/CDR will be helpful here on that last push.

These two low emissions scenarios are the only trajectories that the current science shows will keep us close to or below a 2 degree celsius average increase in line with the Paris Agreement.

At present we're on a trajectory around SSP3-7.0 with emissions predicted to rise (even considering all pledges) by 16% by 2030. Getting solidly onto the SSP2-4.5 path will be a big improvement and then we can push lower from there.

cfyk9x,"If we can't fight climate change, we ought to protect ourselves from it","I've been giving this a lot of thought. Let's be honest here. Will we realistically become carbon neutral before the feedback loops kick in? Will the entire world, aside from just Bhutan, become carbon neutral? Even by some miracle we reach global carbon neutrality, what about the CO2 that's already well above the safe levels in the atmosphere? Are we banking on a miracle upon miracles? 

It seems to me that this war is lost, but we can mitigate our losses. Imagine if every dollar we would've spent trying to fight climate change was instead spent on reinforcing our society. Make ourselves more fire resistant, more hurricane resistant, more flood resistant. We could build emergency spaces for the people who will inevitably be displaced. We could start funding emergency food storage for when we run into shortages.

uuy0vh,West Virginia VS Environment Protection Agency,"The United States Supreme Court is about to limit the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon dioxide emissions related to climate change. This is a very serious issue I would like more people to be talking about, as it will affect every single climate change action taken in the future.

This same conservative Supreme Court has limited States' abilities to enforce water protection law and prosecute pollution.

If States don't provide ""substantial evidence"" of suspected water pollution (substantial as determined by people who are not scientists) in a ""timely manner"" (less than 12 months), commercial projects can no longer be persecuted for any level current or future water pollution. If the evidence is not produced in less than 12 months or is found to be lacking, states are assumed by law to have approved any and all current and future water pollution given off by the project and CANNOT enforce legal action in the future to stop pollution from that project.

Working in environmental science, I have been heavily affected by these things, and I can't help but feel like this is signalling the end.

erdnyh,Legitimate question: How big is humanity’s role in climate change?,"I haven’t looked too much into climate change, I know it’s happening, but I’ve read that human emitted carbon dioxide only accounts for 1.2% of the greenhouse effect. Naturally produced carbon dioxide accounts for about 4x that amount, and water vapor accounts for like 80% of the greenhouse effect.  And anomalies with the sun play a big role. 
Is this true?
I would like informed data on this and not just hate and mockery. I’m LEGITIMATELY trying to find the truth in this era of fake news.

EDIT: the first person who responded did a good job of explaining why the water vapor argument is wrong and how it all works. The only thing left I would like to know is just how much faster do humans make climate change? is there a measurement ? I understand we make it faster but is there reliable data on how much faster and how fast it would be happening if we reduced emissions?

178hz3g,Why not nuclear power pt. 2,"Hi, I posted the original response a few days ago here and have read through many responses. Many people had sensible posts that were not overly mean or cynical. Thank you.

Overall, I feel that I was wrong that nuclear power is our only option and people made some great arguments for and against it.

Here is my big takeaway. Mathematically speaking, it doesn’t make sense to invest heavily in *new* nuclear plants. The cost and time, even for newer generation models, still greatly exceeds other renewable, such as solar and wind. There is just more energy return on investment with solar and wind.

Additionally, the carbon output is takes to build a plant is so great it would take years until the plant off sets there original co2 emissions. There is also always the problem of nuclear waste.

The path forward seems to look something like this:

1. Heavily invest in R&D and construction of solar, wind, and geothermal energy sources. 
2. Update the electrical grid to help the flow of clean energy sources.
3. Invest in energy storage
4. Keep existing, functional nuclear plants operating.
5. Continue to convert all engines that run on fossil fuels to electrical powered. 
6. Reduce energy usage (although this seems least likely to change since it requires the population to change their habits)

Obviously, this is super simplified and a someone posted a great link an IEA that gives a lot of helpful information about a path forward. Check it out here.

a5fqwu,Plants are Solving Climate Change for Us,"I'm trying to get more people into talking about climate change. I would really appreciate it if you gave me feedback on this article. [https://goo.gl/forms/rizdj6OgHQVTgHq03](https://goo.gl/forms/rizdj6OgHQVTgHq03)

Recently I have stumbled upon two fascinating articles - “The Hidden Life of Trees” by Peter Wohlleben and “Reciprocity” by Janine Benyus. They discuss how forests are interconnected and individual trees and plants help each other survive. This is completely different from what we are used to hearing about how trees compete with each other for resources.

Peter Wohlleben realizes that there are advantages for trees to working together. “A tree is not a forest. On its own, a tree cannot establish a consistent local climate. It is at the mercy of wind and weather. But together, many trees create an ecosystem that moderates extremes of heat and cold, stores a great deal of water, and generates a great deal of humidity.” It shows how the cooperation between trees has more advantages than competition. When one single tree is sick, others will support it. Wohlleben compares it to a herd of elephants, “Like the her, they, too, look after their own, and they help their sick and weak back up onto their feet. They are even reluctant to abandon their dead.” The dead refers to the tree stump that was kept alive for at least four or five hundred years. And as is known, trees help sequester carbon into the soil and keep it in there for centuries. “Every tree, therefore, is valuable to the community and worth keeping around for as long as possible.” Even more, trees aren’t just connected to each other. They are also cooperating with other plants. For example, while Janine Benyus was working in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, she noticed that grass under the blue oaks was thriving. It is as if oaks were nurturing it and helping it grow.

However, this idea of mutualism in the forest was not always popular. In 1900s, Frederic Clements proposed this idea. Even though he was very famous at that time, his ideas were replaced by Henry Gleason who argued for the competition perspective. Being compared to Clements became one of the biggest admonitions and “a sure sign of naivete.” But his perspective started coming around lately again because of the facts that scientists could not ignore anymore - trees and plants do cooperate.

It has been found that roots of the trees connect to each other and share resources. Simard defined “Wood Wide Web” as “an underground Internet through which water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and defense compounds are exchanged.” It can be argued that it happens because trees’ roots grow in different directions and connect by accident. However, Massimo Maffei from the University of Turin showed that plants are good at determining whether roots are theirs or not - including other and their own species. Thus, trees connect with each other on purpose. 

But what does it mean for climate change? 

Climate change is caused by greenhouse gases and there are two primary ways to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere: either to reduce emissions or to sequester carbon. Most climate change solutions focus on reducing emissions. However, carbon sequestration can be a great option, too. Mutualism is important for storing carbon in the soil as it requires cooperation between microbial networks and plants. As was already noted, cooperation also makes sure more trees survive which contributes greatly to the amount of carbon sequestered. 

Besides the ability of trees to store carbon, it has many implications for other areas. For example, agriculture. As Janine Benyus points out, “Plowing and herbicides such as glyphosate disturb the network and phosphorus fertilizers tell bacterial and fungal helpers that they are not needed - not needed for water transport or pest defense, not needed to absorb the micronutrients our bodies long for.” It means that we artificially disconnect plants in agriculture from one another and they not only lose their ability to store carbon but also to provide us with nutrients we require. If only we realize how significant these networks are and of what great help they can be to reverse the climate change, we would think twice before interrupting the “vital conversation.” 

But most of all, “Wood Wide Web” can be an ingenious psychological metaphor. We tend not only to view plants as consumers and competitors but primarily ourselves. We are used to believing that the world is a scarce place and we need for fight for our place under the sun. But the reciprocity among trees tells us a different story. Mutualism is a big part of nature which helps us to survive. Janine Benyus notices that, “By recognizing, at last, the ubiquity of sharing and chaperoning, by acknowledging the fact that communal traits are quite natural, we get to see ourselves anew. We can return to our role as nurturers, one of the many helpers in this planetary story of collaborative healing.” When will we finally realize that we, humans, are not the destructors by nature? We can be many things and nurturers is one of them.",1544597425.0,39,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/a5fqwu/plants_are_solving_climate_change_for_us/,carbon emissions,Positive
uyx9ir,"Climate change facts, solutions, and additional resources.","# Facts:

* Daily we emit 117 million tons of CO2. Global CO2 emissions are 43 billion tons each year. [\[S\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)
* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide) [\[S\]](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel2633/feel2633.shtml)
* The ocean has 50 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. The ocean has 39,000 billion tons of CO2. The atmosphere has 750 billion tons of CO2. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)
* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\[S\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)
* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\[S\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)

# Solutions:

* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean. [\[S\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561) [\[S\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full)
* **Direct air capture (DAC):** Use large fans to concentrate CO2 into a chamber and then absorb the CO2 by various means. The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture)
* **Renewable energy:** Wind, solar, geothermal, wave/tidal/marine power, etc. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* **Cultured meats:** Growing meat from cell cultures instead of factory farming. This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC. [\[S\]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/land-use-land-value-tenure/major-land-uses/) [\[S\]](https://cellbasedtech.com/lab-grown-meat-companies) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture)
* **Reducing fossil fuel emissions:** This can be done by scrubbing some of the CO2 from the source before emitting it to the atmosphere. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)
* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions).

1edk91v,"The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 900 pg pdf ""Mandate for Leadership"" quotes about climate change and the deregulation of the EPA","Here are the quotes from ""Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise"" that might concern environmentalists, along with page numbers, explanations and potential issues:

1. **Back to Basics in the EPA**:
   - **Quote**: ""EPA’s structure and mission should be greatly circumscribed to reflect the principles of cooperative federalism and limited government. This will require significant restructuring and streamlining of the agency... EPA should build earnest relationships with state and local officials and assume a more supportive role by sharing resources and expertise, recognizing that the primary role in making choices about the environment belongs to the people who live in it.""
   - **Page**: 420
   - **Explanation**: This approach suggests a reduction in the EPA's regulatory authority, shifting more responsibility to state and local governments. Historically, federal oversight has been crucial in maintaining consistent environmental standards across states, preventing a ""race to the bottom"" where states might lower standards to attract business. Reducing federal oversight could lead to less stringent environmental protections, potentially increasing pollution and environmental degradation.

2. **Reduction in EPA’s Size and Scope**:
   - **Quote**: ""Cutting EPA’s size and scope will deliver savings to the American taxpayer. Improved transparency will serve as an important check to ensure that the agency’s mission is not distorted or coopted for political gain.""
   - **Page**: 446
   - **Explanation**: The proposal to reduce the EPA's size could lead to fewer resources and less capacity to enforce environmental laws. Historically, cuts to environmental enforcement have often led to increased pollution incidents and reduced compliance with environmental regulations. This could particularly impact communities already burdened by pollution.

3. **Critical View of the EPA’s Climate Agenda**:
   - **Quote**: ""Embedded activists have sought to evade legal restraints in pursuit of a global, climate-themed agenda... The EPA under the Biden Administration has returned to the same top-down, coercive approach that defined the Obama Administration. There has been a reinstitution of unachievable standards designed to aid in the 'transition' away from politically disfavored industries and technologies and toward the Biden Administration’s preferred alternatives.""
   - **Page**: 418-419
   - **Explanation**: This criticism suggests a move away from stringent climate regulations. Historically, environmental regulations have played a crucial role in reducing emissions and mitigating climate change. Loosening these regulations could lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and hinder efforts to address global warming, exacerbating environmental problems.

4. **Energy Sector Policies**:
   - **Quote**: ""Opposition from 'Keep it in the ground' environmentalists has made it harder to gain approvals for natural gas pipelines. Under Democrat leadership, FERC has proposed official policies to consider upstream and downstream GHG emissions from the use of the natural gas that would be shipped in the pipeline to be part of FERC’s public-interest determination when deciding whether to approve a pipeline.""
   - **Page**: 407
   - **Explanation**: The resistance to considering full lifecycle emissions in pipeline approvals could lead to underestimating the environmental impact of fossil fuel infrastructure. This could result in more projects that contribute significantly to climate change being approved, counteracting efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

5. **Critique of the Biden Administration’s Environmental Policies**:
   - **Quote**: ""As a consequence of this approach, we see the return of costly, job-killing regulations that serve to depress the economy and grow the bureaucracy but do little to address, much less resolve, complex environmental problems.""
   - **Page**: 418
   - **Explanation**: Labeling environmental regulations as ""job-killing"" and bureaucratic could justify rolling back crucial protections. Historically, such rollbacks have led to increased pollution and public health issues. The focus on economic costs without addressing the long-term benefits of environmental regulations could undermine efforts to safeguard public health and ecosystems.

These quotes highlight a shift towards reducing federal environmental oversight and regulation, emphasizing economic concerns over environmental protections. This approach could lead to weakened environmental standards, potentially exacerbating pollution and climate change issues. Historically, federal environmental regulations have played a crucial role in preventing pollution and protecting public health, and reductions in these areas have often led to increased environmental degradation and health risks.

In addition, the US National Academy of Sciences, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Union of Concerned Scientists all support solar geoengineering research. A 2023 [White House report](https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/KCEP-Digest-59-Solar-Geoengineering.pdf ""https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/KCEP-Digest-59-Solar-Geoengineering.pdf"")  also expressed strong support for the research.

>Experts say support for research is growing because humanity is not doing enough fast enough to reduce carbon emissions to forestall severe and worsening climate impacts. Due to air quality regulations, a decrease in the sulfur dioxide aerosol emissions from coal plants and shipping that helped shield Earth from solar radiation has resulted in the world warming faster than was previously projected, according to a [new study](https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889 ""https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889"") by Hansen and colleagues.

>Most research into solar geoengineering strategies is currently focused on stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI, also called solar radiation management or SRM) and marine cloud brightening; other strategies include cirrus cloud thinning and the use of mirrors or sunshades.

>Harvard’s [Solar Geoengineering Research Program](https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/geoengineering ""https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/geoengineering"") claims SAI could lower sea surface temperatures, which would decrease the risks of coral bleaching, slow the movement of species towards cooler areas and reduce sea ice loss and glacier melt. Results would be quick and buy humans more time to cut carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy.   
      
>But unlike CO2 removal, a multifaceted geoengineering strategy that has more acceptance, solar geoengineering does not reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. It would do nothing to address ocean acidification, which harms marine ecosystems, because the ocean absorbs 25% of the CO2 humans emit, altering its chemistry. Moreover, an abrupt use of SAI may not be effective enough to fully remedy changes caused by a warming deep ocean, such as the [slowing of the Atlantic meridional overturning](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/03/20/amoc-ocean-conveyor-belt-climate-change/ ""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/03/20/amoc-ocean-conveyor-belt-climate-change/""), according to a [recent study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL106132 ""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL106132"").

>In 2011, David Keith, Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program co-founder who is now at the University of Chicago, and atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira estimated that to reverse 10% of the warming caused by a doubling of CO2 levels compared to the pre-industrial era, several hundred thousand tons of sulfur dioxide would have to be injected annually over a decade. To significantly slow warming or reverse it, SAI would require millions of tons of sulfuric dioxide each year. Currently only a few research planes can operate at the necessary altitude because the atmosphere is so thin, and in addition, they are not capable of carrying that many tons of sulfur dioxide. This means that a new fleet of high-altitude planes designed specifically for the purpose would have to be built; creating this fleet could take a decade or more. Once the planes are built, SAI [could cost $18 billion](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aba7e7 ""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aba7e7"") per degree of cooling each year.

Because SAI would not reduce greenhouse gas emissions but only mask their warming effect, emissions would continue to build up in the atmosphere. Right now, the planet is warming gradually. Sudden warming would be catastrophic because ecosystems and humans would have less time to adapt. And the faster the climate is changed, the greater the risk of unforeseen impacts. Natural disasters, terrorist attacks or political aggression could all potentially precipitate termination shock.

>Marine cloud brightening (MCB) would spread sea salt aerosols into the atmosphere to create stratocumulus clouds that reflect the sunlight. Sea salt aerosols are highly reflective, attract water molecules and keep clouds in the sky longer than normal. While salt aerosols occur naturally as winds whip them up from the ocean, MCB would generate them from a floating barge and send them into the atmosphere. By its very nature, MCB would be localized. Some scientists claim using MCB over just 5% of the world’s oceans could offset the impacts of global warming.  
            
>Large-scale MCB that could offset serious climate impacts, however, might also alter climate and weather patterns. A [researcher from UC Santa Barbara found](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/30/solar_radiation_management ""https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/30/solar_radiation_management"") that while MCB could quickly lower temperatures, it would also suppress ENSO, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which affects global weather patterns. MCB could cause the La Niña phase of ENSO to persist, which would make the southern US hotter and drier and increase Atlantic hurricane activity. The research suggested that MCB could also increase warming in Indonesia and Northern Australia.

>Cirrus cloud thinning — High-altitude cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals and thus reflect sunlight, but also result in warming because they trap the heat that radiates from Earth’s surface. Cirrus-cloud thinning involves spraying particles of silver iodide into the clouds at altitudes of 4,500 to 9,000 meters [14,764 to 29,528 feet]. This serves to enlarge the ice crystals in the cirrus clouds so that they fall out of the atmosphere. The fewer and thinner cirrus clouds that remain would trap less radiation from Earth. The risks of cirrus cloud thinning are not yet fully understood, and some researchers are concerned that it could affect regional and seasonal precipitation.

An MIT group is exploring creating a shade of “space bubbles,” while University of Hawaii researchers are considering tying an enormous solar shield to an asteroid. Israeli researchers are designing a small prototype of a group of sunshades that would not completely block the sun but diffuse it. Others have proposed similar strategies in the past. But French scientist Susanne Baur, who studies solar radiation modification, says that the sunshade strategy would be too expensive, too easily damaged by space rocks and take too long to implement.

18i6x4x,How can we stop using fossil fuels in practice?,"I was reading about the half-hearted decisions taken at the end of COP28 and noticed a lot discussions about ending our dependence on fossil fuels.  

That lead me to think about a what short-term solutions\* we have to stop using them, namely, do we have a path for:  
- making plastics and steel    
- asphalt production  
- stopping the use of fossil fuels in boats (especially cargo) and airplanes?  

What I think I know about the subject (please correct me if I'm wrong):  
- bioplastics seem to be generally polluting as much as oil-based ones (being polymers that are hard to break up), require crops in vast quantities and some emit methane during decomposition  
- steel requires coal as far as I'm aware, the alternative being hydrogen but our cheapest source of it by far is natural gas   
- asphalt requires oil  
- cargo boats and airplanes would require batteries with an energy density we don't have right now  

I'm curious to know what solutions we have (right now or in the foreseeable future) to get rid of fossil fuels in these products.

\* Let's say 2050 for the sake of the argument because I can't see this happening in 2030 even in a perfect world where all countries suddenly decide right now to stop their use entirely.

**EDIT:**  
After reading your comments and more links about the subject I added some details to my initial statements above to try and make them more clear/directed.    

**Caveat:** Obviously a combination of many/all of the carbon emissions reduction solutions may work and is probably the right solution but I can't see how I could make a guesstimate of this myself, that's the kind of paper I'm looking for though so if you have any links about that I'm curious.  

**PS:** Since I started this thread I've been spending more time answering comments than reading on the subject so I may have to pause for a bit to ponder on what was said and reading about the pointers I got.",1702554461.0,31,207,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/18i6x4x/how_can_we_stop_using_fossil_fuels_in_practice/,carbon emissions,Positive
1gmf4wd,Acceptance is important ,"Acceptence is not doom, it's understanding. 

First, we are talking about geological time scales, so let's keep in mind that a ""very short"" climate change might be 5000-10,000  years. Much of that is a foregone conclusion, even if today all fossil fuel burning ended. 

Second, you're just one person, and you are nothing on the scales climate change exists on. The emissions cuts you make, over your whole life, won't undo the industrial machine humanity had become since 1900, maybe longer (sea sponges show data of carbon building up in the 1800s)

Real mitigation may be beyond our reach now, especially post 11/05, but one day we might re green the earth.  Keeping the hope alive is paramount.

 The easy answer are fading away, but perhaps tomorrow we find unique solutions. Maybe we just adapt. 

I'm somber, sitting with the fact we've failed to do more. But I do believe life will adapt more than people currently believe it will. Life survived a gamma ray burst, a meteor impact, and multiple Ice Ages.

a5v8q8,Helping the Planet Even After Death by Being Made into a Tree,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ix8i88qvr2421.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e7bdd301a94e7fe0de1ae84b9dd97213f8dfdd0

Hey everyone, I’m doing a project where I write about an eco-friendly form of burial and get feedback on the writing (any kind of feedback really helps).  Also there’s a TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

THE GIST OF IT

Some companies offer biodegradable urns to people as a product that can incorporate the cremated ashes of a person with growing a tree.  In this way, it differs from a traditional burial, but the body’s remains still return to the soil in the end.  While, tree seedlings can’t really grow in ashes, there are different ways biodegradable urns find a way around this.  For example, the Bios Urn has different levels for the soil, seeds, and ashes.  According to Elizabeth Stinson from Wired who wrote about this, “When the root system grows strong enough—generally after a week—water will dissolve the top of the second chamber, allowing the roots and minerals to mix with human ash.”  The company also produced the Bios Incube, which makes it easy for people to know when to water the tree and monitor it.

&#x200B;

CAN HELP AIR QUALITY IN CITIES/NEIGHBORHOODS

If more people started using biodegradable urns, more trees could reduce the impact of greenhouse gasses emitted in the city.  In places where lots of drivers commute, planting new trees helps lessen the impact of car emissions contributing to climate change.  In some cities where officials are concerned with the rising rate of asthma, creating new trees could help.  Plus, having a loved one’s ashes (or maybe yours someday) be turned into a tree near your house/apartment may increase the surrounding air quality.  With products like the Bios Incube, it can be put inside the home and liven up the room too.

&#x200B;

BIODEGRADABLE URNS VS TRADITIONAL BURIAL

You can help others know about biodegradable urns and how green they are, but of course, it is always important to be respectful of others’ wishes and the traditions of some families.  Some families are firm on a traditional burial or only placing the ashes in a temple, but many still have yet to decide what to do.  If people did decide to place their ashes with a biodegradable urn, the worry of how much carbon dioxide cremation releases would be overshadowed by the amount of greenhouse gasses trees absorb through their lifetime, which according to the UCSB ScienceLine can be 100s or even 1000s of years.  While traditional burials take up a lot of unusable land, becoming a tree after you die can go into creating forests, parks, and e.t.c. Julian Uzielli and Lara O'Brien from the CBC report in an article that, “Countries such as China have already started to relocate existing graves and ban future ones, which has been deeply upsetting for those who've already laid loved ones to rest.”  The scarcity of land for graves left also often makes biodegradable urns a cheaper option.

&#x200B;

OTHER BENEFITS

The biodegradable urns can be set almost anywhere and therefore be placed in closer proximity, even in the house if you wanted to.  They can also be planted along walk areas, and improve scenery.  Taking care of the tree could also be a way to deal with the loss of a loved one. It also sets a good impression on future generations to think about the issue of climate change. If someone grows a fruit tree, that tree has the potential to yield fruits for them too.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: After death, you can help suck out carbon dioxide from the air in the form of a tree by placing your ashes in a special urn that companies have designed to mix ashes with soil and completely biodegrade while the tree grows.

qfm742,"Rethinking Climate Change: How Humanity Can Choose to Reduce Emissions 90% by 2035 through the Disruption of Energy, Transportation, and Food with Existing Technologies"," 

Technology disruptions already underway in the energy, transportation, and food sectors have extraordinary implications for climate change.

These three disruptions alone, driven by just eight technologies, can directly eliminate over 90% of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide within 15 years. Market forces can be leveraged to drive the bulk of global GHG emissions mitigation because the technologies required are either already commercially available and competitive today, or can be deployed to market before 2025 with the right societal choices. The same technologies will also make the cost of carbon withdrawal affordable, meaning that moonshot breakthrough technologies are not required to solve the ‘Last Carbon Problem’ and go beyond net zero from 2035 onwards.

Key Findings Key Implications of the Energy, Transportation, and Food Disruptions for Climate Change

1. We can achieve net zero emissions much more quickly than is widely imagined by deploying and scaling the technology we already have.
2. We can achieve net zero emissions without collateral damage to society or the economy.
3. Markets can and must play the dominant role in reducing emissions.
4. Decarbonizing the global economy will not be costly, it will instead save trillions of dollars.
5. A focused approach to reducing emissions is better than an all-of-the-above ‘whack-a-mole’ approach.
6. We no longer need to trade off the environment and the economy against each other.
7. The clean disruption of energy, transportation, and food will narrow rather than widen the gap between wealthy and poor communities, and developed and less-developed countries.
8. The same technologies that allow us to mitigate emissions will also enable us to withdraw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere affordably.
9. Societal choices matter, and technology alone is not enough to achieve net zero emissions.

The Age of Creation

Humanity is on the cusp of the most profound transformation of the system of production in human history; from an extraction-based system dependent on exploiting scarce inputs (resources and labor) that requires scale and reach and centralization; to a creation-based system; a generative model that creates the things we need from super-abundant inputs available everywhere, and that is distributed, interconnected and networked. The complex problems in society, from climate change to conflict and inequality, are an inevitable outcome of this extraction-based system of production. In an extractive system, a ‘growth imperative’ is the key underlying evolutionary driver.

Civilizations that grow their capabilities and reach the fastest, spread through conquest or mimicry. Zero-sum competition forces societies to exploit or be exploited, hardwiring environmental degradation and inequality into the system. Societies that fail to exploit people and the planet slow progress and become footnotes in history. Thus, all these problems are at their root an outcome of our extraction-based system of production. However, society is blind to this critical insight and the possibility of an alternative. Our reductionist, narrow, linear mindsets mean we fail to appreciate the complex processes of change driving the disruption of our production system and are hence unable to recognize the speed, scale and impact of this transformation.

This failure means we see these problems as ‘wicked’ intractable issues with no good solutions. That might be true within the framework of the incumbent system, where zero-sum trade-offs mean that solving climate change for example, impacts economic growth; but this is not the case in the emerging system, that allows us to address all our problems together without trade-offs, as if cutting the Gordian knot.

Unfortunately, conventional blindness to this opportunity compels us to focus our efforts on solving yesterday’s problems, by patching up the old system through ‘Band-Aid’ solutions which address the symptom not the cause. While many of these ‘Band-Aids’ have some use in holding the current system together to prevent collapse before the new system emerges, they must not be mistaken for ‘cures’. Other ‘Band-Aids,’ however, can divert valuable resources (time, attention and capital) away from the optimal interventions and even risk shutting off the route to breakthrough.

The impending transformation of the production system driven by disruptions across the five foundational sectors of civilization represents a phase change: a fundamental change to the system state where all the conditions, rules and relationships are re-configured. This system thus cannot be understood through our existing mindsets, nor governed by our existing organizing system. This is why disruption comes from the edge. The greater the expertise of the current system, the more there is to unlearn. The advantage of incumbency will become the baggage of incumbency.

Only by relinquishing our reductionist mindsets and embracing a lens built on complexity and holism can we hope to identify the root cause of our problems and seize the extraordinary opportunities emerging allowing us to avoid catastrophic risks. Our hope is that this work will help reframe debates across society and help us recognize the possibilities of a new system.

If we can learn to see the world through a broader, clearer lens, we can properly diagnose our problems so that we can prescribe the right medicine, and avoid making decisions that waste valuable resources on misguided interventions.

18pn3ct,More Good News in 2023,"**Battery technology made some big leaps forward**

CATL, the world's biggest battery maker, announced a new battery with double the density of Tesla's batteries which it said would go into mass production imminently, Toyota, the world's largest carmaker, claimed it had developed a solid state battery with over 1,000 km of range (and then got trumped by Chinese EV maker NIO which pulled off an actual demo of 1,000 km battery) and Swedish manufacturer Northvolt announced a breakthrough in sodium batteries, an element that's cheaper, more abundant, and more sustainable than lithium.

&#x200B;

**We found plenty of raw materials for the transition**

After years of hand-wringing about the lack of critical materials, this year saw the discovery of huge new deposits of lithium in the United States and phosphate in Norway, a plunge in lithium and cobalt prices as new mines and processing plants solved shortages sooner than expected, and multiple studies showing that the world has more than enough materials for the clean energy transition. Reaching net zero will only take one quarter of today’s lithium, one-third of nickel and a quarter of known cobalt resources. These studies led to the creation of our favourite clean energy graph of the year.

&#x200B;

**Geothermal had a breakout year**

In April, Lazard, widely regarded as the industry standard for the average cost of energy technologies, shocked analysts with the news that geothermal, the dark horse of the clean energy revolution, was competitive with fossil gas. Everyone was even more surprised in November, when a startup announced that its next generation geothermal plant had started sending carbon-free electricity to the grid in Nevada, proving that the earth’s heat could be a commercially viable, huge source of carbon-free power.

&#x200B;

**America and Europe got serious about transmission**

In one of the most important, and least appreciated energy stories of the year, the US government approved major reforms governing new connections to the nation’s grids, broke ground on thousands of kilometres of high voltage power lines, and made its largest transmission investment ever into 58 projects across 44 states. Regulators in Europe also got the memo - the European Commission drafted plans to scale up investment into Europe's power grids, giving special status to at least 68 projects, with access to faster permits and funding.

&#x200B;

**BYD became the biggest electric carmaker in the world**

In April, Chinese automaker BYD put the global automotive industry on notice with the launch of its compact, fully-electric Seagull vehicle, with a starting price of $12,000. By November, the company had produced 200,000 of them, making it one of the fastest-selling vehicles of all time. This capped a standout year in which BYD overtook Tesla in sales, and then overtook Ford to become the the world's fourth largest manufacturer by volume, producing its six millionth vehicle in November, just three months after reaching five million.

&#x200B;

**Europe and America got serious about methane**

Methane is the second-biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide, so it was really good news when, towards the end of the year, the EU launched a continent-wide tax on carbon in imported goods, the first time such a tax has been tried at this scale anywhere in the world, and then reached a deal on a law to place methane emissions limits on oil and gas imports starting in 2030. Even better, just before COP28, the United Stated implemented the most protective methane pollution limits in the world.

&#x200B;

**Finance fled from coal, gas and oil**

Over three quarters of coal-fired electricity in the OECD is now on track to close by 2030, and the IEA's estimates for fossil gas deployment have halved in the last five years. Danske, the second-largest bank in the Nordic region, declared an end to fossil fuel financing, SMBC Group, Japan's second largest bank, said it will phase out all exposure to coal mining by 2040, CBA, Australia’s largest bank, ruled out finance for new oil and gas extraction, HSBC and BNP Parabis said they would no longer provide finance for metallurgical coal, Citi, the world's second-largest funder of fossil fuels, committed to cut lending to the thermal coal mining sector by 90% by 2030, and Chubb, the world's biggest property and casualty insurer, said it would no longer provide coverage for oil and gas projects without a plan to reduce methane emissions, or if they are located in any of the world’s 284,122 protected areas.

1e8ufcm,Is Climate Change the Most Pressing Issue in the World?,"I have a friend that doesn’t deny the reality of the climate crisis and our need to act on it, but he is more concerned with other pressing issues such as nuclear weapons or a great power war. 

The 80,000 hours website, an organization within the Effective Altruism movement considers risks from artificial intelligence to be the most pressing world problem, followed by pandemics, nuclear weapons, conflicts between great powers, and then climate change. Their ideological roots originate from philosophers like Peter Singer, Toby Ord, and William MacAskill. I understand though that this movement is not without controversy (with their affiliation with Sam Bankman-Fried being a prime example. 

I’ll admit I haven’t looked deep enough into this issue but I understand the World Economic Forum and UNESCO have listed climate change as the most pressing issue in 2024. 

Personally, my opinion is informed by overwhelming evidence of climate change and its risks, in addition to the fact that we won’t even have a civilization where we can handle other pressing issues if we don’t solve the climate crisis.

If anyone could point me to arguments, research, studies, credible organizations I would greatly appreciate it! ",1721590251.0,470,341,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1e8ufcm/is_climate_change_the_most_pressing_issue_in_the/,climate crisis,Negative
17udfhg,The Sixth Mass Extinction,"
Are we currently experiencing the sixth mass extinction event or are we rapidly approaching it?

We may be undergoing the first mass extinction in history caused predominately by anthropogenic factors. Or are the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis precursors to the sixth mass extinction. Although, the IUCN red list could be used to interpret that the global extinction rate matches the background rate. But, an estimated 28% of species are threatened with extinction and potentially irreversible changes are being made to the planet. Changes such as ocean acidification, climate change and pollution.",1699890254.0,336,211,https://medium.com/@amusta542/the-sixth-mass-extinction-b4080b7d35d4,climate crisis,Negative
16q4nwt,To people who think climate change will cause human extinction in the near future - why?,"I’ve often come across people on this forum who seem convinced that climate change will cause human extinction in the next hundred or so years, but when I engage with them I can’t get a good reason for it. I think people are misreading the science and are in danger of creating accusations of alarmism (or are actually alarmist). If I’ve missed some important models that predict this existential crisis then please inform me - are there any credible scenarios that predict human extinction in the next hundred years? I’ve never seen one.


Edit: since this has got quite a few responses, it seems that extinction is used by many people to mean the same as “human society collapsing”, or just really really bad for humans, and that I might be using the word too literally. For those people arguing that CC has potential to be really really bad for us - I agree with you 100%. Also, my apologies if I was a bit curt in some responses, like “that’s not extinction”, or something like that. Wasn’t trying to be rude. For me, I’ve only ever used that word literally, and that may account for some of the misunderstandings I’ve had on this sub.

There are also some people who do mean it in the literal sense. It seems that these are opinions/conclusions that they’ve come to themselves rather than getting it from a study (which is fine, not attacking that at all). I just happen to disagree. I also don’t have a list of studies conclusively showing that we will not go extinct. I think there are some debates on here where I’ve thought we were arguing over what is clearly established, and others may have taken it that we were arguing over a difference of opinion.

None of that changes the physics behind our climate crisis one iota, and the physics are very clear about the reality that the refuse from the activities of 8 billion human beings is providing the fuel to make the fire burn.

It doesn't matter what the effect of this or that action will be on the economy either. Or folks easy access to convenient road travel - that's irrelevant too.

What matters is the physics and only the physics. And this can make the task of discussing the climate crisis somewhat daunting. After all physics a huge area of study with its own written and spoken language.

I've read some really great books that discuss very complex physics subjects in easy to read, pedestrian language. These books talked about flooding and bridges we drive over and how many hours it takes sunlight to reach the Earth. And as more and more people get to directly and immediately witness first hand the changes, then these descriptions make more and more sense to more and more people.

Has to be done quickly, however. I think it can be done, but as I noted above, the climate crisis doesn't really care what I think.",1691844646.0,82,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/15p3tbt/our_climate_crisis_is_about_physics_and_nothing/,climate crisis,Negative

Most people i talk to say something along the lines of ""we've always figured it out and we always will."" They are failing to meet their own climate goals, failing to reduce their cow situationship (no other word for it really if we're being honest haaa). I am not aware of a settled plan/strategy for sea level rise, only 4 different"" options ""closed, open, advance, and accommodate"". But i havent heard of a commitment to a plan or action taken towards it. 

Meanwhile, there's also a massive housing crisis. Homes are getting more and more expensive. Even as the ocean rises. This seems to have zero impact on the housing market somehow. 

My family wants/needs a bigger house, but i hesitate to dump so much of our net worth into an asset that seems.... Possibly inevitability going to be literally under water. Yet, we love living among the Randstad canals...... 

Does anyone have any insights into how to think about all of this? Do the Dutch have a reason i do not see to be so comfortable and to be apparently taking their time? Is there any holistic argument to justify or rule out tieing my family's financial future to a beautiful canal-side property?

16oon4p,🤔 Confused about global temperature increase & climate change,"I was recently at a local museum on west coast BC, Canada that had a board on glaciation on the region, Gabriola Island. There was a graph indicating 'The Earth has been getting progressively colder over the last 50 million years' showing the relative temperature fluctuations. There is a zoom in of the current interglacial period.

Images: [https://imgur.com/a/ZAitJaw](https://imgur.com/a/ZAitJaw)

Can someone who understands the science explain to me, within the context of the current climate change crisis, how our relative global temperature increase deviates from past glacial events?

For example, climate scientists say that a 1.5-3° average temp increase is catastrophic to global systems. But on this graph, it shows over the past 500,000 years fluctuations of +6°C to -3°C as normal. Our current period is totally in line with the last 4 periods.

Further, it shows global temperatures cooling (Global temperature variations over the past  50 million years) from a relative temperature  that was 14°C higher than current temperatures!

So how does the science work in all of this? Is this just a human crisis and not a planetary crisis, meaning it's catastrophic to humans if the temperature rises 3°? Like if the sea levels rise 200' its catastrophic to us but pretty normal for the planet?

As a lay person I don't understand.

UPDATE

As others have pointed out, it's the current short term rate of temperature increase that is catastrophic to humans, not that the earth can't support a temperature increase.

t7xfgy,I got lost while trying to understand climate change,"tl;dr: I faced contradictory opinions on what is going on and I do not have the scientific background to debunk or accept the research I read, I have linked all kinds of different articles I have read and the research that got to me be lost.

After spending some time researching climate change, what's actually going on, I'll go through what I went through, as a college student who is only just now looking into the climate crisis and trying to understand it, I live in the middle east so I'm not as much faced with the debate and news as other countries.

I have first watched the Netflix documentary ""[Our Planet](https://www.netflix.com/lb-en/title/80049832)"". It gave me a ground for understanding how the eco system works and how the climate effects are affecting the world as we know it now, like one example on this is the poles melting, how the ice is home to many animals, and what a rising sea level will cause to humans,. Also how green lands are being affected and how much deforestation has happened that is killing the earth's lungs, and how the melting of the ice means more heat is being trapped in the sea.

I also read through [The EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) that helped in understanding how the change is taking place and how the fossil fuel companies are responsible for big part of this.

I went through all the data provided by [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/139/video-global-warming-from-1880-to-2021/) on climate change and how terrible the situation looks to be, how the highest records of temperatures were recorded only the last two decades.

I also looked onto the [6th assessment report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) but didn't understand much, as I have a hard time with scientific research since English isn't my first language, but it gave the impression that we are doomed I guess? Like there are effects that are just irreversible at this moment.

Some countries, underdeveloped ones, are being affected the most right now, with effects of climate change being lived.

I have watched the documentary [""Before The Flood""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbEnOYtsXHA) and it was eye opening to many facts.

Then I visited the [""before the flood"" website](https://www.beforetheflood.com/explore/the-crisis/), it said that in the near future we will witness: heat waves - disease spread - decreased food and water - bigger hotter wildfires - more storm damage - coastal displacement - growing conflict where food and fresh water will be harder to collect for more than 3 billion people - species decline: climate change is expected to greatly reduce the natural habitat for more than 1/3 of all animal species and 1/2 of all plant species on land by 2050 threatening as much as 25% of all terrestrial species with extinction by the end of the century - and ecosystem collapse.

A [Ted video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wJo5aKBwq0) explained that the current actions being taken that disagree with the Paris agreement do not meet what was planned and puts us on a trajectory of reaching 2.9°C by 2100 or better view says 2.4°C. And the fact that short term actions do not match the plans.

The video also explains how the GHG emissions need to be half by 2030 for the world to be brought into a 1.5°C pathway. But still the actions being taken today won't achieve this target by 2030.

There are good news as well. The fact that renewable energy is the new normal for a new power production capacity worldwide because it's cheaper, there is some transitioning to electric cars and some sectors are starting to move out of investing in fossil fuels.

These good news, how good are they for the climate? I mean if these things are happening does that contradict everything negative I've said above, or are the good news just not enough to combat the change, what's actually needed at this point?

Because I have also read the article on a website called ""real climate"" and they article is titled ""[we are not reaching 1.5°C earlier than previously thought](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2021/08/we-are-not-reaching-1-5oc-earlier-than-previously-thought/), I also had a hard time understanding what I read but, every time I read more I am faced with different opinions, people saying that it's not as as bad as we think, or that [the media is pushing the worst case scenarios as the truth.](https://issues.org/climate-change-scenarios-lost-touch-reality-pielke-ritchie/)

I seriously don't know what is actually going on at this point, I mean we are feeling the effects, animals are already going extinct, and the poles are melting,

w1dhnf,How do you feel about climate change?,"I recently just graduated from my undergraduate program in Environmental Studies. I am pursuing a masters degree in global wildlife health and conservation and hope to pursue a doctorate degree once done with that. Last night I came across this [website](https://www.isthishowyoufeel.com). I read so deep into the letters from climate scientists all over the world. I feel the exact same way: powerless, small, tired, frustrated, angry and so many more emotions. I try to be hopeful, after all I am just one of many pursuing an education in both climate change and wildlife conservation, but still I feel hopeless.

Day by day, especially in the US, I see law makers going back in progress. I have hope in being surrounded by climate scientists and conservationists but no matter what we do, it seems to go with no action by the law makers. Europe is having a massive heatwave, the southern US is also having a massive heatwave. People are struggling and yet you still find the climate deniers everywhere. I recently discovered the climate skeptics page on Reddit and going and having a look at that was probably not a good idea because it just frustrates me even more.

I went and saw Professor Brian Cox recently at a show and afterwards my boyfriend said to me about how we scientists ultimately fail at communicating our science to the general public. And I had many classes covering communication of science throughout my undergrad. But despite, there just seems to be a barrier between scientific communication and those who just don’t want to know. It truly is so frustrating to me.

I plan on dedicating my entire career to climate change but mainly to aiding the wildlife that we selfishly have endangered them through our very own actions. And so, I do remain hopeful that there are other people like me dedicating their lives to science, the climate crisis and the helpless.

And so, I wanted to start this thread, similar to the website I discovered last night. Write your answers in more of a letter format. I just want to see how everyone else feels. What they are doing to help, etc.

cyznyy,Why is “global warming” our biggest focus environmentally?,"To start, of course I understand global warming is real. (ETA I understand global warming is real and CATASTROPHIC. I am terrified about how we are destroying the planet and personally believe it will likely happen much faster than we are currently predicting). 

But for a while, I’ve struggled to shake the feeling that the term “global warming” and the focus we give it is being pushed to the forefront by the people who are the biggest offenders in the climate crisis. 

Before you shrug it off - the earth getting “warmer” is the only thing about ecological destruction that *doesn’t* cause immediate feelings of panic. There are plenty of people even on this sub that think the “earth will turn into a rainforest” and other ridiculous things if we keep emissions going at the rate they’re at now. 3-5*C makes me think there will be more sunny days, not the apocalypse. 

Why are we (people who believe in the preservation of the environment for the survival of humanity, if for no other reason) not focused on any of the more viscerally disturbing things that come along with climate change? They all seem like the bigger problems, and much more urgent (for lack of a better term) than the strict warming of the planet. 

- insecticide/pesticide/herbicide use & conventional ag destroying our pollinators and surrounding ecosystems 
- deforestation & development causing our water sources to dry up  
- pollution of waterways/groundwater/oceans from drilling/fracking/mining/oil spills/dirty development/ag runoff and waste mismanagement 
- pollution of our air with dirty energy generation 
- toxic chemicals pervasive in our everyday lives 
- impending collapse of wild food sources we rely on heavily to survive (ocean fish, for example) 

Any of the above seem to be way more compelling and open to far less debate/knee jerk skepticism than the hard to define, hard to “feel” (how many of us heard everyone complaining about how we “needed more global warming” during the winter cold spells?), and easy to reject/minimize “global warming.”


In short - is “global warming” a term pushed by oil companies, etc to cause us to get stuck in circular debates about the temperature while we pollute and destroy the ecosystems we rely on for survival?",1567482610.0,37,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cyznyy/why_is_global_warming_our_biggest_focus/,climate crisis,Negative
b5qeq8,Has eco-anxiety influenced your parenting/parenthood decisions?,"so i am a student and journalist writing for my college publication as well as the online magazine [theoutline.com](https://theoutline.com) so this is a topic i would be interested in like writing about but i've been thinking a bit about something a few friends of mine have mentioned about how they are planning to not have children themselves or plan on choosing to adopt when they'd originally wanted to have children themselves in reaction to the climate prospects we face. i've never wanted children so this wasn't something i'd considered but hearing them talk about it really broke my heart because clearly this was something born out of their general eco-anxiety which we all share. at the same time when i told older friends of mine this, they kind of dismissed it as ""oh they'll grow out of that"" and i just don't know if it's so simple? i know there's been discussions of the ""ethics"" of having kids amid the climate crisis but im more interested in going beyond the theoretical and getting at the actual implications/results.

i guess the **tl;dr** of what im trying to get at, especially as an undergraduate college student, is whether folks who are already parents or planning families have taken practical actions out of their eco anxiety to shift what their families will look like (no kids, adopted kids, no more kids etc.)

We keep arguing on whether it is actually a problem or how we should change individual lifestyles rather than focusing and supporting actual change that is already occurring.

I believe if we become more aware of how people/companies are tackling the problem at the moment we can be more informed of how we can support this change and make a difference now. I love all the educational videos as well but we need a fundamental shift where people are aware of careers they can pursue or which companies they need to work for if they want to shift the consensus and take action on climate change.

# About me

24; Germany, Bavaria; trained mathematical technical software developer; Part time employee, warehouse logistic robot development; Founder of 2 indie game studios and a local game industry cluster; Game Designer, 3D-Design/Printing, Programmer; vegan; sportsclimber; gamer; VR enthusiast

# My Live

I am really loving the things I work on. Working hard on achieving milestones on the way of building up a sustainable business fulfills me a lot.  
News, documentaries and my social media feed remind me regularly about the extensive crisis we are in right now. This motivates me to act more sustainable: Reducing car usage to a minimum - veganism - drawing green energy - repairing clothing instead of buying - reducing plastic packaging - buying regional food.

# My Problem

1. The limited time I leave myself for food consumption and food buying results in buying plastic packaged food at restaurants and supermarkets. Although I would have the opportunity to use a packaging free (zero waste) store in our city and cook meals myself.  
2. It is frustrating to watch the german government signing more coal mining contracts, ignoring climate goals and subsidizing air traffic over public transportation (Flying within Germany is cheaper than going by train).  
3. The biggest pain was when i realized that it is counterproductive to proselytize sustainable habits. You can just be a positive example to you surrounding and hope that people realize it themselves. Discussing unsustainable decisions of fellow people is mostly just annoying them an resulting in contact reduction.

Climate crisis is not visible in Germany, we are hardly affected by now. And the causal chain behind the climate change is too complex for people to understand.

# My vague ideas

\- Using my skill of gamification to educate people, by joining existing projects or starting them myself. ***Is there already things happening?***  
\- Joining other sustainable projects, fully committed, quitting everything else. ***Any project suggestions?***

***Is there forums, threads or channels where I should browse through?***

pry5o3,Underestimating the impact of climate change and flash flooding,"Hey team,   
Not sure if it's because I'm originally from Australia, but when I thought of the main environmental impacts of the climate crisis in the past, I've always thought in terms of increased bush fires and rising sea levels. 

I think this summer, we've seen a number of events that suggest flash flooding may also be an absolutely massive challenge. I recently spoke to an expert on flood modelling on my podcast and he said that because the atmosphere is holding more and more water as the planet gets warmer, we will see increased instances of flash flooding. On top of that, he said flooding is predicted to have the most significant economic impact of all climate change based perils in the coming decade.

vjtxy3,California Climate Change Risk VS Refuge Zones (Update #1),"(Update #1) 

\- There has been a dramatic increase in wells running dry in the South East & North West sections of the Central Valley. The ground in certain areas has sunken 10-28 feet due to aquifer depletion. Once this happens the water does not come back underground to that location. Areas in the North West Central Valley that typically get 12.5 inches of rain have only gotten 1.5 inches. The grass in that region did not have enough water to complete their life cycle and dried two months earlier than what typically is expected. The worst areas were in West Shasta County and West Tehama County, but water depletion was observed throughout California interior landscapes.

\- There are emerging implications of the drought as Central Valley farmers leave more than 400k acres empty. Normally vast landscapes of watered crops have a cooling effect on the local climate through evaporation, but this year dry empty fields will likely cause drier air this summer and allow temperatures to get much hotter in the Central Valley, a region which already gets triple digit heat.

\- Due to the water shortages many hydroelectric dams will be unable to operate, which utility companies are warning in advance will cause outages during peak demand in summer. This could be a cascading effect causing a dramatic spike in heatstroke among local residents. Unfortunately we are also predicting a very severe fire season this year, which will also impact both on-grid and off-grid solar for extended periods of time, possibly even months. This combined effect could leave many people running on generators while gas prices are already extremely high.

\- Zone Blue #1 Northern Coastal areas are still predicted to remain most habitable (from Marin County to Del Norte), Coastal Humboldt County and Coastal Del Norte County seem to have the healthiest ecosystems currently out of all samples we have taken. Plant and soil moisture levels are optimal in these locations at the present time even though elsewhere there has been drought degradation in nearly every other region in California. We believe this is likely due to the region's ability to generate it's own precipitation from Coastal fog. The mountains seem to do a better job at trapping the coastal air in this region, which allows the clouds to reach dew point after they enter at night and form nighttime drizzle occasionally. This area also benefits from cool ocean air during summer causing evaporation to be slow. The ecological health of this region is the only positive news we have to report during this term.

\- Unfortunately in the Sierra mountain range & the Eastern Mendocino mountain range there has been unprecedented tree die off both from drought and from a snowstorm during winter that caused a build up of heavy snow on branches. This caused drought affected trees to buckle and break during winter. But as the branches and trees dry out during summer it will add to the fuel load during fire season. This alone will increase fire risk. But worse even is that the surviving trees that were damaged heal themselves by increasing resin output. We have measured it this year, and there is significantly increased resin that could cause the trees to become extremely dangerous if they catch on fire, possibly to the point of explosive combustibility. If there are fires on either of these mountain ranges it often causes extended smoke accumulation in the Northern Central Valley which could lead to unsafe air quality for cities such as Redding, Red Bluff, and Chico.

\-The last three years have been La Nina years. Which causes cool surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This usually creates a cooling effect over the West coast of the US, but unfortunately it has had very little impact at stopping the extreme summer heatwaves which inland California has been experiencing annually. We do worry about how high the temperature could climb once La Nina has finished it's cycle, because this year Earth has reached it's highest CO2 content to date. Additionally La Nina should cause increased precipitation for Northern California, but instead there has been far less.

\-Comments: We are witnessing a rapidly changing climate, and we've been working hard to document as much as possible. We believe that just as inland Southern CA is a desert, inland Northern CA will also soon become a desert. Desertification is happening all around the world right now, and this is where we are observing it happen here. 

\[\[ Original Post below \]\]

For a college project my group spent half the year studying regions in California for their future habitability as climate change progresses.

We researched both on the ground and using public climate and event records.

The regions listed above are 2 high risk land areas and 2 climate refuge land areas.

As simplistic as our presentation is our findings are based on lengthy and rigorous studying. Please be respectful in the comments because I am not going to argue with anyone on here. Often people that dispute the facts are either personally invested in high risk areas or they are climate change deniers. I don't have the patience for either. The reason I'm posting this on reddit is to gather public responses before our presentation.

The purpose of the presentation is to reach out to developers so they can start preparing housing and business in safer locations as the climate crisis continues.

* (High Risk Zone: Red #1) The Central Valley is a low lying flat region. Most of the central valley is going to be high risk, but the highlighted area is of particular concern. In this area high population cities such as Sacramento are located. The elevation in Sacramento is 26ft. When people think of areas impacted by sea level rise, most people think of coastal areas. But the reality is for California most of the land impacted by sea level rise will be the Central Valley region. Most coastal locations in California are situated far enough above sea level to be safe. Los Angeles for example has a elevation of 305ft and will continue to be well above water inundation. Unfortunately for low lying inland cities such as Sacramento, the rise will overwhelm infrastructure. Ground water will likely get pushed up from underground before ocean flooding even arrives. This region is also heavily impacted by wildfire smoke because the central valley acts like a bowl trapping the smoky air in. The region is already known to have some of the worst air quality in the nation, but the increase in wildfires is adding an extra air quality hazard on a regular basis.
* (High Risk Zone: Red #2) The Western facing Sierra foothills is the highest risk wildfire zone in California, and likely the highest risk zone in the United States. The elevation of the sierra foothills is 500 ft - 4000 ft. You may think at those elevations that the climate would feel cooler, but as someone who has a lot of personal experience in this area that is not the case. Unlike the Central Valley, the Sierra Foothills does not have access to the delta breeze, which is a cool coastal wind that provides relief on hot summer days to the Central Valley. Additionally those elevations are not high enough to create a cool summer climate and the added UV impact in this hot climate just makes it sting to be in the sun and heats up houses faster. The air heats quicker at this elevation which causes a larger portion of the day to be hot. 90F in the sun at this elevation often feels worse than 100F in the Central Valley. Las Vegas for example is 2000ft elevation and is the second hottest City in the United States. The summer heat in this region is often underestimated. Recently a young family in Mariposa county died because of heat stroke while on a morning hike. Wildfire risks here are high. 60 percent of rain in California falls in the Sierras. But it all dumps down within a few winter months and then it quickly gets hot and dry for more than half the year. The high winter precipitation creates a lot of brush that burns. High winter Rainfall and the hot dry summer which has only been getting hotter and drier is why this area is such a fire risk. Additionally the types of vegetation that grows in this region burns hotter than most woods. Not all forests are equal when it comes to fire risk. Unlike coastal California, the humidity inland is vastly reduced and fires thrive in the dry air. Humidity levels in the foothills are often as low as 5% because extra moisture doesn't arrive from the delta breeze. Even after severe wildfires a new wildfire can happen every year due to the dry grasses and the fact that organic matter on the ground takes years to decompose during the extended dry times. This means that even the top soil can burn. Paradise CA and Greenville CA which both completely burned down within the last few years are located in zone Red#2. The cost alone for fire insurance in high wildfire risk zones is around 5-10× more to insure. Which will suppress development for businesses and farms in these areas. All this combined makes the Sierra Foothills area one of the least habitable regions based on our data.
* (Refuge Zone: Blue #1) The Northern California coast has elevated topography that will not be impacted much by sea level rise. Additionally the cool ocean air gets trapped into the coastal region making the air cool and moist. The trees in the coastal belt of far northern California are more likely to moss over than burn. Additionally the coastal winds that move West to East and mountain range shelters the area in from most wildfire smoke even when there are fires blazing inland. This area particularly stands out as a refuge away from extreme heatwaves. For example during the Pacific Heatwave of 2021 Redding CA was nearly 120F while Eureka CA was 65F-70F at the same time. Summers and winters in the area are mild, and as climate change continues this region will likely be one of the most comfortable climates in the United State. We predict this area will soon be a extremely desirable location to live due to the weather. Similar to how Santa Barbara is in present day.
* (Refuge Zone: Blue #2) The high desert region in southern California will be considered a climate change refuge because of the lack of flammable vegetation. Although it does get hot here, as wildfires continue to get worse a new appreciation for desert life will likely arise. Additionally because there is very little forest upwind of this area, wildfire smoke will be less of an issue compared to most other interior regions.

Closing thoughts:

We would like to be a voice of encouragement for developers and investors to utilize these less populated refuge regions in order to prepare the near future population for displacement and climate change related disasters. The only long term cost effective solution is a slow preplanned migration.

There are other risk and refuge locations that we identified in our research, but these are the areas we found to be most significant. We wanted our presentation to be easy to understand as a guide for development.

171eb9m,What is you opinion about how climate scientists are using social media?,"I'm a regular on Twitter - I know, not exactly a bragging point - and I often see climate scientists posting their latest findings and speculating on what they could mean. I get that they may be doing this with the best of intentions and almost as a cry for help to be heard, but I'm not sure it's working. Here's why:

1. When scientists share new findings with the general public, who aren't climate experts, it often leads to confusion because there can be a ton of expert views on the same discovery. Don't you think it'd be smarter to hash out these discoveries within academic circles until there's a common ground or better understanding, instead of tossing out initial data to the public and jumping to conclusions?

2. A lot of these posts are really intense, full of doom and gloom. This can make people feel helpless, especially those who are worried about the climate crisis. Some scientists are even saying we've crossed a point of no return, predicting a dystopian Mad Max-style future by the century's end, if not sooner. To me, that feels reckless. Yes, the situation is serious, but there are so many variables at play to make such absolute predictions. Worse, these doom-filled messages could lead people to think there's no use in even trying. It seems like these messages are more likely to discourage action than encourage it.

3. Publicly sharing these views invites trolls and climate change deniers to flood the comments with contrary opinions, dubious graphs, and wild theories. I wonder how many people genuinely interested in the climate crisis get swayed by these deniers' arguments.

During the peak of the COVID pandemic, similar patterns emerged on social media. Experts presented complex data and personal opinions regarding vaccine efficacy and the risks posed by new virus strains, aiming to inform the public. However, this often resulted in greater confusion, anxiety, and doubt instead of clarity. It seems we're repeating this scenario with climate scientists.

I'm not sure what the best approach is, but perhaps scientists could avoid sharing unreviewed findings or those that haven't been thoroughly debated academically.

But I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.",1696603833.0,28,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/171eb9m/what_is_you_opinion_about_how_climate_scientists/,climate crisis,Negative

So, let’s try to think of more drastic ways in which we can try to save the planet and humanity from the climate crisis.

I’ll begin:

The Pandemic has taught us that with enough political and societal will, we can take effective measures to greatly decrease emissions, all it takes is will from both the Governments and the people. Restricting international flights and increasing remote work are the easiest ones. Also, transitioning into a mostly plant-based agriculture system, reducing the work week, etc. 

Even restricting international flights for only half the year could be good, or having “quarantine”-like months or a week per month, like we did in the Pandemic, but without the social isolation.

Of course, this won’t come without a cost. My country’s economy is heavily reliant on tourism. Without international tourism we’d lose many jobs. Governments would need to prioritize meeting the basic needs of the population, such as food, water and shelter. Maybe through UBI. But that would require a huge cultural shift.

Can you think of more drastic but realistic measures that could save us?",1688236835.0,23,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/14o2c2u/what_drastic_measures_could_be_taken_this_century/,climate crisis,Positive
rudq0s,Thoughts about a climate change series that sticks to the science.,"Hey guys, so I am writing a web series that takes complex climate science principles and breaks them down so the general audience can understand them. In addition, I am referencing all of the papers I obtained my information from and providing them to viewers so they can read these studies for themselves. 

What I would like to know is, what climate science facts would you like to know? Even if you think it is silly, please share it with me. I want to get some more episodes written before posting these and I will be happy to share with the community when they are up 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗

My goal of this is to provide the general public and outlet where they can get this information and have resources to break them down. 

Background:
Why am I doing this? I got my Bachelors of Science in climate and atmospheric science. As someone who is trained formally in the subject, I think climate science is important information to combat the climate crisis. If we as a collective focused on the science, and coming up with solutions that align with the science, we as a collective can migrate towards solutions that meet environmental goals.",1641142437.0,26,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/rudq0s/thoughts_about_a_climate_change_series_that/,climate crisis,Positive

177eiqv,Why not nuclear power,"At first I was against nuclear power, but the more I looked into it, I think it is the only way to combat climate change. 

Right now it is the only energy source with no CO2 emissions that can produce energy on the scale that people demand. Clearly the world is not interested in cutting emissions, so shouldn’t governments like the US, China, Russia and other nations with nuclear infrastructure build plants ASAP to cut back on fossil fuels? Why not create a power grid relying on  nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, ect…?

We’ve basically mathematically missed the window to develop other “green” energy sources on a scale needed. Leaders should admit that nuclear energy is the only option. It can be a MASSIVE energy source.”

Also, yes, there is nuclear waste, but developing other clean sources like solar, contributes massive amounts of toxic waste.

To me, it seems like the least bad, practical option right now. Am I wrong? I honestly hope I am.",1697248016.0,1173,2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/177eiqv/why_not_nuclear_power/,powering buildings,Positive

Nuclear power plants should only be shut down when fossil fuels burning plants don't exist anymore.

1gessui,"Solar, wind, wave - ok... why the hell is no one talking about tidal energy?","There are loads of talks about how solar and wind energy alone aren't enough if we really want to move towards clean energy. Yet there's more and more chatter about building more solar and wind farms and investing in these renewable sources - while we all know we need a mix of different renewables to really make a difference. It's the same old story for everyone - the sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow... yea yea... you can see it especially in the UK where wind energy drops off dramatically during the summer.

I've been following CorPower Ocean's journey (https://corpowerocean.com/a-short-history-of-wave-energy/) for a while now, and I'm really chuffed about their recent big investment. While I'm glad there's more discussion about ocean energy, I really feel there's a lack of talks about tidal energy. Tidal energy is predictable and reliable, and I know some people say it's not always there, but as long as the moon and gravity exist, tides are pretty much always around - not like waves, solar, wind, etc., which depend on the weather.

There are already some great tidal energy technologies that can produce clean and, most importantly, reliable energy - like Orbital Marine Power, Nova, and my favourite one because of their seashell design and technology that's completely 3D printed and, as I understand it, much cheaper than other technologies - Spiralis Energy (https://www.spiralis.energy). Yet, they all lack investment, and more importantly, tidal energy itself isn't getting the buzz it deserves, even though it could be a really big deal.

x9ud1q,Actually worried about the Earth running out of oil.,"So much we do relies on oil sadly, and many things can't be replaced yet. I think clumate change is the number 1 danger to our slecies and planet, so I am not being defeatest or brushing anything off here. Bear with me.

Though we keep finding more and more oil deep in the ground, it is nothing sizable compared to our yearly needs and the deeper it is, the more fracking and risk to shale and the water table. Read something from Stanford University saying at our current use, the Earth only has 47 years of oil left. With this being said, besides energy, transport, and lubricants, we use oil for chimical production, such as solvents for extracting, pharmaceuticals, fertilizer, pesticides. We also use it for plastic, and granted that plastic gets a bad name due to singke use plastics building up in our environment, multiuse plastics and recycling of essential things (like dialysis tubing, electronics, medical equipment, lab tools), we make fabrics out of it too. My point being we should replace the use of oil for everything we can, fund new solutions where we can't, and save as much as we can for the things we can't replace it with. Things that don't involve burning or volatilizing it, where it can be reused or recycled. I recall seeing a Canola plant that used hexane for 1 part of their extraction process. They could reclaim and reuse it many times over. I can also see chemists finding a large mixture of various hydrocarbon chains as useful starting points in synthesis. Perhaps there are lifesaving drugs that are much cheaper when starting from here, than to need to synthesize long hydrocarbon chains, and this could be the difference between saving lives by making a drug affordible, or butning it in a car to get somewhere instead of using an EV (or public transit) or burning it in a power plant instead of using green or nuclear power. Even if we are just making a pesticide or fertilizer to grow crops to feed people, the thought that will have issues when we run out unless we find valubke replacements I think should put us in a state of emergency in itself.

Like, I think besides environment and health/clean air, there is a totally economic and resource centered point on why we should save these plentiful hydrocarbon reserves for chemists and synthesis of things. There could be all sorts of untapped or unknown uses for oil in the future that doesn't involve heating our planet, making our oceans acidic screwing waterways, decreasing the nutritional content of plant life, or making polymers to build up in our environment. And besides the more ideal use if it, until we know how to go without it, we are talking about something we will need when it comes to growing enough food for our population and making a variety of medications. We shoukd keeo funding solutions and replacements for oil, whike also retaining as much as we can and requiring any and all alternatives to its use to be the standard.",1662726876.0,47,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/x9ud1q/actually_worried_about_the_earth_running_out_of/,powering buildings,Positive
13q606m,"I have about $50 million to spend, how can I have the biggest impact on fighting climate change?","I have an unreasonably large amount of money.

I'm thinking I should start a company that will make a product to fight climate change.  For example, my company could be a solar company, putting up solar panels. 

What is the thing I can do that will have the biggest impact?

For example, if I create the solar company, where should I build these solar power plants to have the greatest impact?  Do I put them in California, because they already have a lot so the regulatory hurdles will probably be easier, and they get a lot of sunlight.

Or should I put them in West Virginia, because they get most of their electricity from coal so replacing that electricity with solar will have a bigger effect than adding more solar to the California grid.  (I don't expect a solar power plant would be very welcome in West Virginia).

Or should I build a solar power plant in India, because they have a lot of need for additional electric power, and if solar isn't built, whatever is built will probably be less clean?

Or am I thinking about this all wrong?  Is there something else entirely that would have a greater impact on reducing future co2 levels?

And just to be clear, I only have about $50 million to spend.  So things like developing a passenger airplane that runs on batteries, or building a nuclear power plant, are too expensive for my budget.

I am not willing to spend the money trying to influence political action, or spending the money on an advertising campaign trying to get people to change their behavior.  

And of course if I can make money with my actions that is a good thing, because it then means I have even more money available to do even more to reduce future CO2 in the atmosphere.

zct271,The coming rise in aridity is not discussed enough," Many different effects of climate change are highlighted in popular media, but i feel like the scariest and most impactful one is not discussed enough. 

Yes it matters that sea level is (slowly) rising, that glaciers are melting, and it very much does matter that summer temperature extremes will get more frequent. However i can't help think that by far the most important coming change, that is not nearly stressed enough in common discourse, is the increased aridity that we'll likely face in many areas of the world. You can see it reverberate into a million other effects. It shut down hydropower plants in China this summer, (along with the factories that need that power), and slowed river trade on the Rhine in the heart of industrial Europe. 

Most importantly, aridity means less food. It means failing crops, especially in the already arid and hot places around the world, often places that do not have the development level where their economies are able to produce other wealth that can then be traded for imported food products. In other words, certain subsistence small-scale farming regions of the world, that depend on household farming, will find it harder and harder to make ends meet.  
And the problem unfolds in boiled frog manner. Each year these countries might get less and less easy to feed, and thus more under pressure and potentially politically chaotic, so less and less able to organize into building large scale infrastructure improvements needed to counter this.   
And you can see it has no easy solutions, even developed Europe this year had no choice but to let some of it's crops die (look at Italy or Romania), the scale of water needed for agriculture means you often can't just run a pipe from somewhere else and solve the problem. To me, aridity and related food production are really THE biggest climate change problem in the coming decades.

PS:Yes, it's true that some areas (quite a few actually) will get more rain as well, but it seems many of those areas are not the ones that really need the rain.  

PPS: While predictive models models are never perfect, i found this map from carbon brief quite useful:

1g62j85,Why individual choice matters how to respond,"I keep seeing this phrase of ""Nothing I do matters. So why should I bother? Companies are the real problem""

First of all I am not absolving companies of the problems they have created.

I am talking about individual choices.

1. Companies produce and sell goods and services for us. They do not make them for themselves.

If we make responsible choices and vote with our dollar, and vote for politicians who make better laws, we are making a difference.

2. Education is also key. It is imperative that we educate ourselves. We can not fully get off oil right now. We just can't. So it's good to try to buy from oil companies that are under strict laws. Canada has some of the strictest environmental laws regarding their oil. It is stricter than the US and Saudi Arabia. It might seem counterintruive to build the some pipelines, but it would help China get off coal power which is a million times worse.

We can't fully get off oil. but we can reduce the amount we use.

Individual choices DO matter, and I am tired of everyone trying to evade responsibility for their own actions.

I believe there was a king of the hill episode of this where instead of making changes they bought carbon credits. Hank who is a true Conservative with the ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" philosophy was horrified.

I am too. If you try to say something, about how we can do better, people attack you. ""What about your Hvack systems?"" What about it? I don't use air conditioning. They will attack you for your failures. Just because we can't be perfect, it doesn't mean we can't do our best.

Edit: It isn't easy being green. But nothing worth doing ever is.

A thousand people reducing my 8% makes a bigger difference than nobody doing anything, because companies are a bigger problem. It also makes more of an impact than 1 person being perfect.

It is worth considering that the country that generated the waste should be responsible for managing it, but in terms of the 100,000 years required for geological disposal, the life of a country is only a moment in time. Scattering final disposal sites at various locations around the world is not only inefficient but also dangerous.

ipq4j6,Wrote a short Essay on Climate Optimism on the Spot,"I just wrote a short Essay on Climate Change Optimism, spontaneously and directed towards doomsayers who think our efforts are futile. I wish to share it with you all. Please tell me what you think of it.


> I know my words won't reach most, but i'll say 'em anyway:


> Even before Covid hit, the global emissions rate of increase (between 2016-2019) slowed down 20% thanks to new policies, the collapse of the coal industry, the rise of renewables and climate lobbying - than otherwise. Think about it. Emissions slowed down. They are reaching the 2C station but they are slowing down. Despite Trump. Despite Russia. Despite China. Despite the oil and coal lobbies. And now that Covid has hit the coal industry has been dealt a blow it will never recover from. Oh there's still the gas industry? Sure. But we're slowing down. And that's the first step to mitigation. The overton window on that front is shifting, slowly but surely.

> The second step is peaking emissions, grinding the emissions increase to a halt. There is good news there too. Demand for renewables is skyrocketing. Old fossil fuel factories and power plants are getting phased out or shut down at an increasing rate, across the globe on average. As the cost of renewables plummet, it's cost-efficiency eclipses coal, then eventually gas, and many, many energy corps, companies and lobbies are beginning to pay attention and follow that clean new golden goose. Greed drives them, sure, but the sort of greed that is much less destructive on our global environment than otherwise. An improvement. Back to emission peaks. China is planning to reach it's peak soon. It's rapidly building new, more efficient coal factories, sure. But their electricity output is decreasing. And while it is not yet giving way to being eclipsed by renewable output, it is planned to do so later this decade. Which means China may reach peak emissions before 2030. And then, as the world's largest emitter, begin to decrease emissions entirely. 

> Yes there is worsening news regarding climate change all the time. It's to be expected. Increases in emissions from earlier decades are what are being felt right now. Those mistakes we've made as a global civilization have already been set in stone. All it does is make our goals harder, not stop them in our tracks. What we have control over, as the overton window shifts, is how we handle, adapt, mitigate, and survive the coming decades as best we can. There is still time for all of this. Despite Trump's efforts the US' emissions have not skyrocketed since he took office, for example. Heck, the expected worse case scenario from carbon emissions has gone down 2 degrees, from 5 C to a far less catastrophic 3 C, thanks to our global decrease in carbon demand and emissions here and there. And slowing down the rise of carbon emissions is our top priority right now. 
 

> Despite all the pessimism, there is still, and always will be hope. And through hope and progress, we must, we shall, prevail. Thank you for your time.

bvtbnz,"Supercritical CO2, closed loop Geothermal wells and the promise of universal carbon free base load Renewable power","Yesterday I posted a link to  DOE review of the untapped potential of Geothermal power Plants.  this post is in response to questions posed in comments to that post.

Here are a number of links that will help explain the potential of supercritical CO2 and as I see it, its incredible potential if applied in closed loop Geothermal wells to provide base load Renewable power while sequestering the CO2 working fluids required to drive the power plants.

supercritical CO2 explained:

**(Extra add, this demonstration is in a well system abandoned as a source of high pressure steam as it was producing too little hot water to continue to efficiently drive traditional steam turbines.** **Green fire calls their system “ECO2”** **but it is really just their application of the obvious benefits of using CO2 instead of water as the turbine working fluid.)**

p4kfg5,"I have 40 acres of trees that I plan to build a homestead on and live off grid in the future, anything I can do to capture carbon with this much land?","Basically as title.  Is there anything I can build/do to boost carbon capture?  Trees on their own are not really enough at the rate carbon is being spewed into the air these days, I know there's lot of talk about carbon capture tech these days but is there anything that I can realistically do?  Whatever system it is, I would basically run it on spare energy.  I will need a large solar array to run everything year round since the days are very short here, but in the summer months the days are very long and I would produce more power than I need.  Is there something I can do using that energy to capture carbon?  And most importantly how would I measure this to see if it's actually working?  Also is it futile to even try to capture carbon at ground level since the real issue is in the upper atmosphere or will it still help?   

Whatever the system is, I would want to end up with a non hazardous product that is a solid or liquid at room temp so I can burry it or something. 

It will be a drop in the bucket but way I see it, if I can at least make my carbon foot print negative then I'm doing my part I guess.  I currently still have a gas truck and I will probably need to use gas powered equipment to do the initial land clearing to build but after that my goal is to run everything including heat on solar/wind and other renewables.   I will buy an EV as soon as I can afford one.    I will also want to plant at least double the trees that I cut.   They cancelled the tree planting program here in Ontario when the conservatives came into power, so I would probably take it upon myself to go plant in areas that have been clear cut.",1628991244.0,23,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/p4kfg5/i_have_40_acres_of_trees_that_i_plan_to_build_a/,powering buildings,Negative
pmwr1c,A tough economic choice,"I own a small apartment building. I'm faced with replacing all the HVAC for various reasons. My cheapest option is replacing the existing gas furnaces (not even gonna consider 80% efficiency furnaces, going with high efficiency 96% condensing types) and minimum efficeincy air conditioners. All the existing units gotta go for safety and code compliance reasons. 

I could consider installing heat pumps, using all electric heat, and rely on the eventual conversion of the grid to renewable sources to reduce the carbon footprint in time.   My electric utility's renewable percentage is currently abysmal, just 3.9%, but that will surely rise over time. Heat pumps will cost me more than furnaces. In the short run, 5 years, heat pumps will have little improvement in carbon footprint over gas furnaces because of the dismal renewables portion of this utility. 

I wonder about the odds of natural gas being phased out over the expected lifetime of these units (15 years).  if we can't buy natural gas, or it's made to be uneconomic to disincentivize it, heat pumps would be a great idea.  but natural gas is ubiquitous - is a phase-out even on the table? We'd better be considering phasing out all natural gas by 2035 if we want a planet. 

There is the potential of offsetting some of the dirty power with on-site solar, no economic payback for me as the tenant's pay the utilities. 

What would you consider to be Carbon footprint pros and cons of a decision to spend extra money for all-electric heat? 

Will update post in a bit with a quick calc of the carbon footprint of both alternatives.

UPDATE: some (rather depressing) data

Carbon output for EPA eGrid subregion SRMW: 1584 LB/MWH (among the worst in the nation)  

Annual carbon footprint with 96% AFUE furnaces, SEER 13 air conditioners, sum for building:  7198 KG

Annual carbon footprint with HSPF 9.0 heat pumps, SEER 14 AC performance: 8058 kg

Cost premium for installing heat pumps:   ~$2500 (about 25% of the total project cost) 

Unless renewables percentage rises, the heat pumps cost more and are a carbon loser. 

Percentage of utility renewables required to make heat pumps less polluting re; carbon:  14.5%

There are no predictions as to how long I'll have to wait before my utility gets with the program and increases their renewables percentage fivefold.",1631466749.0,21,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/pmwr1c/a_tough_economic_choice/,powering buildings,Negative

c18wl0,What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?,"I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.  

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.

&#x200B;

5. How do we deal with complete discreditors?

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism.

129t7cv,Nuclear could solve all our problems.,"I am all for green energy. I think it is good to have options and the self reliance that solar offers. We don't have to worry about building massive grids everywhere when an isolated community can make their own power. No doubt having a steady and constant power flow is an issue, but I don't think it is an end all to green energy at all. I also realize that with green and nuclear, as with everything else we do, we will never have zero impact on out planet. But we should at the very least try to lower our impact below the threshold of causing mass extinction.  


I know many here are fans of nuclear. So ill try not to go too far into it and have a limited understanding myself. Long term storage of waste is possible deep in the ground of tectonically stable areas. We mined the radioactive metals out of the ground, and the heat from our core is caused by nuclear reactions in our core. So digging deep to a spot that will eventually get recycled back into the core is basically just returning our waste where we got it from, perhaps in a more radioactive state. We can't pull CO2 out of the air and put it back into the ground (coal, oil, natural gas, etc) in an energy efficient way that doesn't create more CO2, unless we use green and nuclear energy to do so. Fusion power is just around the corner too, as there have been some breakthroughs, but nuclear the way it is now is the only feasible and scalable energy as far as I know, as green will take a while to scale up, and there are issues with power storage. I'm not saying lets not use green, but if we have deadlines to meet, lets use what we already know. It takes decades to make a powerplant, but perhaps working with governments we could streamline the process in a safe and manageable way. There is a company that turns old coal power plants into nuclear plants currently. The coal plant has the turbines needed already, but instead of a coal oven, a reactor is put into place. Converting all our coal plants to nuclear sounds like a great and fast way to reach our goals of limiting our planets warming. There are even some reactor concepts that can run on nuclear waste from other reactors and unenriched uranium too, which is great for nations we might be paranoid of, enriching uranium that could lead to more proliferation of nuclear weapons.  


I have heard a setback with nuclear energy is downscaling the power production during off-peak hours in a way that doesn't fry the grid. I think that what we should do is keep the necessary amount of powerplants running for peak hours constantly, but divert the excess energy to carbon capture and desalination of water. Carbon tax can pay for the energy used to remove CO2 (as well as still fund research in other methods). This way we can not only replace methods of energy that produce carbon, but offset even more carbon, and ideally one day, even undo our emissions of the past. Even better if we can make products out of the CO2. Desalination would be good for preventing some areas from drying up. The Colorado river has not flowed all the way to the ocean for many years, as we are using that water for various industries (as well as more evaporation with a heating planet). Many areas in the developing world also suffer droughts. If we could get the developed world on board, not only can we vastly improve their lifestyle without having to rely on more fossil fuel emissions, we can bring clean and drinkable water to them for farming and drinking.  


Again, I am not saying lets give up on green energy. I think we should double down on it too. But considering we have many points of no return and the urgency of our current situation, we have a solution now that we are not using, and can be used to kill multiple birds with 1 stone: Usable water, carbon capture, and carbon neutral energy.",1680459250.0,15,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/129t7cv/nuclear_could_solve_all_our_problems/,powering buildings,Positive
1g0ke58,What is and what isn't attributable to climate change? ,"I have a question I was hoping more informed people could provide some insight on or counterpoints to. I am not going to argue back with counterpoints, I genuinely want to gain knowledge on where some of my understanding might be lacking. I am not a climate change denier, nor do I want to try and downplay the impact of climate change.

It seems to me like we often conflate the issues of overpopulation and imprudent planning with climate change. For example, people living on the gulf coast will always be subjected to hurricanes and the more people that live there, the worse the damage and loss will be. Nothing will change this as long as people flock to build in areas subjected to powerful storms, though I understand stronger storms mean more damage.  Likewise, building a large city in the middle of a desert seems like it would undoubtedly result in reduced lake and river levels even if rainfall did remain unaffected by weather patterns. Simply blaming changing weather patterns for blatant overuse of limited resources seems unfair. There are many counterpoints, such as the recent flooding in areas that had never seen that type of flooding before and I understand that it can be attributable to bigger storms. However, deforestation and an increase in impervious surfaces also contribute a lot to the flooding issues and those are not climate change related issues in my opinion.

Not trying to downplay climate change, but I do often find myself frustrated hearing people in the news equate nearly all of our issues with natural disasters entirely to climate change and personally I think it is disingenuous to do so. At what point should we acknowledge that it is impractical to build and live in certain places and will always be likely to do so, even if / when we are able to get greenhouse gas emissions under control?

obkqp0,Don’t know where else to ask about this. What if designated current nuclear plants for carbon capture and storage. How many nuclear plants would we need to use and how long would the system need to run to clean the entire atmosphere? Is it even mathematically possible?,"Made an error in the title. It’s “What if we designated current nuclear plants for carbon capturing and storing”.

This question is meant to look for an answer to what if we absolutely run out of time, and we decided to turn every way of consuming power into green energy in a very short time, like a couple of years, also building new nuclear plants and transforming the current ones for carbon capturing and storing in a very short time we might have left.

It's important to understand this because we might not have enough time to upgrade the entire infrastructure and wait for things to cool off by themselves, as we might no longer have enough trees to capture all the carbon in the air over time, even if we stopped the entire human activity today.",1625142334.0,15,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/obkqp0/dont_know_where_else_to_ask_about_this_what_if/,powering buildings,Positive
nwpxj2,Climate Migration In California,"Because of the wildfires many people in CA are migrating. For me, fire insurance went up to $4000 a year, then jumped up again to $7000 a year. Power shutoffs in the slightest breeze (so many times with no AC) when it is 115F outside and 105F in the house. All our food going bad. Constant smoke for half the year. Those who's houses burn down are put on a waiting list by contractors to rebuild, and with new building codes for fire protection, increased prices of wood, and lack of available contractors, rebuilding the same quality home is often not an option. And using the money to buy a new home means competing with other fire refugees. So many of them end up living in travel trailers on their burnt land. Turning neighborhoods into burnt RV parks. So with a baby on the way we decided to move. I went over my options. Well I thought if we leave CA than people in other states might hate us because of the State we are from. I know many States do hate CA. I also wanted to stay closer to family. So I realized my options were the Central Valley, desert, high desert, or right along the coast. The Central Valley fills up with wildfire smoke and is prone to extreme heatwaves, so I crossed that off. Low lying deserts are very hot aswell. My two primary options were high desert or higher elevated places along the northern coast where cool moist air comes in. Above where sea levels will ever rise. There is a lot of land in Humboldt that sea level rise will not affect. I chose Humboldt County. If you think it's a dangerous place, that's pretty much a joke. Humboldt bay is very family friendly. Don't judge the region if you've never lived there. Driving through doesn't count. Climate wise it is similar to San Francisco, but the mountain range blocks the inland air, making that coast less prone to heatwaves. If you're on here to hate, just don't. We are happy here. The weather is nice. The redwoods are beautiful, the coastline is beautiful. Everyone we've met is friendly. Been here for 7 months now.

135m43u,"Renewables will not work, Nuclear is the only realistic path forward","It's unfortunate that there are so many well-meaning but uneducated people talking about energy. and IMO sabotaging in the public discourse on the **only realistic** path to a carbon-free future in our lifetime.

Renewables are cool, I like the sight of gleaning solar panels and massive wind turbines. and solar panel prices have been coming down recently (they are probably as low as they are gonna get though). I'm all for the almost free Hydro power wherever it's available, Hydro is probably the best energy resource ever: clean, free, and continuous. but it's finite and pretty much most of the world's hydro is tapped already.

Unfortunately, the other renewables have some fundamental and currently unsolvable problems. unsolvable in terms not of whether is physically impossible to solve them, but rather that the solutions are so radically expensive as to make it impractical. namely storage.

There are startups that will tell us otherwise, touting their world-changing technology, it's their job to sell it. but simple thermodynamics and back-of-the-envelope calculations show that the storage price grows to astronomical numbers very quickly.

Example:

Say we want to replace a typical coal plant of 3GW to solar with storage. for storage, we will use  lithium-ion Tesla powerwalls (9000$ for 13.5KWh). Where I'm at is pretty sunny, but there are whole weeks sometimes when the sun doesn't peek through the clouds. say we want to store 3 days worth of full consumption (the power plant is at full capacity), realistically can be stretched to like a cloudy week on only storage.

So: 3GW\*24h\*3days= 216GWh

216GWh/13.5KWh=16M powerwalls

16Mpowerwalls\*9K$/powerwall=**144,000,000,000$ or 144B$**

\*(the price of 3GW of solar is just 4.5B$ at 1.5$/W)

\[this simple analysis has some simplifications, but even if it's off by a few 10%, the bottom line is that the price to store only 3 days equivalent of a simple power plant is \~100B$ deal\]

if storage is to be adopted at scale, the price per battery will be even higher, as the main price driver in it is lithium, and it will be in short supply.

Are cloudy weeks realistic? yes, entire cloudy months are realistic. if you chose the above solution and still paid 144B$, tough look, either you spin that dirty old coal plant again or go back to the stone age.

And not only that, but those things have a lifetime of 20 years, and even after 10 years you are down to 70% capacity. so be prepared to pay \~100B$ every 15 years or so.

Not to mention how unfeasible it is to build such a facility, at 1sqm per powerwall, it would take 16sqkm. and in the very likely event of a fire, that 144B$ facility will go up in mega fireball of unquenchable flames. all it takes is one in a billion cells shorting to set that whole tinder pack ablaze.

As we are talking about what is realistic today, I'm focusing on existing, commercially available solutions. But most of those considerations remain in place for any battery technology. it is remarkably difficult to store electrical energy in chemical form. any gains in storage density will be modest, most likely expensive, and with downsides in other domains. And all battery technologies degrade over time.

Ah, but what about pumped storage? yes, it's great but it's only possible in very select alpine locations, so it's irrelevant to most of the cases worldwide. and where it is possible is usually not where there is a large renewable potential.

Bottom line is large-scale storage of electrical energy is infeasible currently, and most likely in the future as well.

And what ends up happening when pushing renewables at all cost, is that the grid must fall back on dirty fossil fuels to take up the slack a large part of the time. that is the reason Germany's electricity is both very expensive and still dirty.

Nuclear on the other hand is a proven, scalable, and clean tech. 3rd and 4th generation reactors are passively safe, meaning that a melt-down is physically impossible. and there are even designs that can burn old waste. breeder reactors can generate 2 orders of magnitude more energy out of the same fuel. it is compact. and with the global supply of uranium and thorium available, it is essentially limitless -the sun will boil the earth billions of years before nuclear fuel runs out.

nuclear waste is from an engineering standpoint a non-issue, the entire annual output of the world could fit in a football field. there is ""plenty"" of space underground to store it even if we don't burn it.

But most importantly, it is available **TODAY** to solve climate change. there is no ""it's just around the corner"" tech required to make it work. it has been working for decades. the current cost of nuclear is not because it's inherently very expensive, it's due to excessive and often hostile regulation, stemming from public paranoia and mistrust cultivated by misguided 'green' organizations.

If governments were to take this as an important priority, a universal or couple of universal designs could be created, and copied around the world in the span of a decade.

There is of course a place for renewables, somewhere between 20%-40% is probably the most optimal ratio. the rest must inevitably be nuclear.

We could cut emissions by 80% in a decade if nuclear was scaled worldwide. and eliminated completely in three. it's just a question of political will. While renewable wishful thinking will inevitably bring us to another century of emissions and global warming. Those are trivial extrapolations.

Edit:when correcting for retail to grid scale prices per kWh the price calculation reduces to \~76B$. still astronomical. and doesn't take into account future lithium price inflation in widespread adoption scenario (lithium prices jumped 6X between 2021-2023) so the ball park might be even an underestimation",1683036169.0,13,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/135m43u/renewables_will_not_work_nuclear_is_the_only/,powering buildings,Positive
cmsia9,Will stuff like Ecosia make a significant contribution?,"I've recently been using Ecosia, ""the search engine that plants trees,"" or so they say.

And, well, it seems very legit. Ecosia releases its financial statements, they've been building solar plants to power their servers, and they have pictures and videos documenting their work. They also don't seem to use your data in any suspicious ways, at least not any worse than Google's use of your data. So it seems very legit.

My question now, however, is whether Ecosia and other small businesses can make a substantial impact on the environment. You should use it whether or not it makes a substantial impact, but still... will it?

If the answer is no, then ok, we should double down on influencing governments to the environmental cause.

If the answer is yes, then how do their impacts compare to the effects of efforts by other non-business environmental organizations like interest groups (or environmental lobbyists in the U.S.) and political parties?",1565107564.0,11,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cmsia9/will_stuff_like_ecosia_make_a_significant/,powering buildings,Positive
1goz6pg,Understanding the argument against nuclear power,"I've realised my knowledge of climate change is quite poor, so I'm trying to understand some of the arguments and resources out there.

The first point of [this Greenpeace article](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/52758/reasons-why-nuclear-energy-not-way-green-and-peaceful-world/) pushes against nuclear power because *doubling the capacity of nuclear power worldwide in 2050, would only decrease greenhouse gas emissions by around 4%*.

In other words, it's effectively arguing we wouldn't be able to build enough nuclear power stations to replace the existing coal/oil/gas ones in time.

I can therefore only assume that the solar and wind options it suggests are substantially easier to build (which makes sense), and that we can build enough of these in time to bring the emissions down.

But is there anything which outlines how many solar/wind sources we'd need to build to replace the existing dirty options? And that this is definitely feasible?",1731349521.0,12,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1goz6pg/understanding_the_argument_against_nuclear_power/,powering buildings,Negative

p77r9q,Population Density? - To save the World?,"So, reading an came across this [(map)](https://twitter.com/hannahker11/status/1329163888680706050?s=20)by Hannah Ker based up the [(data set)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/lulc-human-modification-terrestrial-systems)... which made me think...what are the possible solution to this?

So first thought, kill 6 billion of the 7 billion...but I find that morally out of my comfort zone ... and If I am being honest I do not have enough to offer the world, so I would be in that 6 billion....

So, a few shitty ideas later.....I had a less shitty idea...

**Increase population density, to the point where humans are interacting with less than 1% of overall landmass.**  That would allow nature to rebuild itself, with a little help, replanting and what not.  While maintaining a decent quality of life, for humans ...

In order to accomplish this...we would require **100 cities with 100 million people each**, with a population density between Manhattan and Tokyo -  vertical factory farming, hydroponic farming, aeroponic farming, and fish farming, desalination, free efficient public transportation, powered by renewable energy and nuclear…connected by hyperloops or bullet trains.

This will take time and stages....So, the first two cities to be built would be connecting Sudan or Somalia, to Mauritania or Western Sahara, via hyperloop. This is mostly for freight not people. Allowing shipping companies a cheaper alterative to the suez canal or horn of africa, while reducing the pollution. The hyperloop would require solar on top, and trees to be planted on either side in order to reduce damage from sand, this also creates carbon sink.

Those first two cities and next 30-40 Cities would allow us to raise, 3-4 billion people out of extreme poverty while reducing their overall carbon, pollution, and impact on environment. building these cities it allows us to better organize, maintain, and redevelop key infrastructure for recycling, sewage treatment, and trash.

In order to build these in any manageable time, and allow for reasonable accommodations, we would need to factory prebuilt mix use skyscrapers; retail/commercial on ground floors, office mid, residential top. Each building would be one acre footprint and require space for 1,0000 people. So the city would be 100,000 buildings on a 100,000 acres without industrial, which would be about 160 sq miles per city. So 100 cities at 160 sq miles = 16,000 sq miles out of  57,308,738 square miles of earth...which is .02%  .... So if we are allowing up to 1% of the earth to be used, this allows .98% of the earth or \~557,087 sq miles to be used for; vertical factory farming, hydroponic farming, aeroponic farming, fish farming, desalination, renewable energy sources,  nuclear energy, and other industries.

How much do you think it would cost?

20 billion a year for the next 40 years?

or how about 100 billion per year for 30 years?

you know what your right!  250 billion per year for 40 years....absurd right?

American's give \~$456 Billion per year to 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 organizations per year...

If you actually read this whole thing, I appreciate it...I am going to go put on my tin foil hat, and wait for the replies telling me I am crazy for writing this wall of text...just needed to write out some of this idea I have rattling around in my head, I have a bit more, but that seems good enough for now...Have a good day!",1629346932.0,9,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/p77r9q/population_density_to_save_the_world/,powering buildings,Positive
oh97r6,Want to know what happens in a. hundred years? Read this,"Came across the wiki page for the Easter Island, off The Chilean coast in the South Pacific:

&#x200B;

*Archeological record shows that at the time of the initial settlement the island was home to many species of trees, including at least three species which grew up to 15 metres (49 ft) or more. At least six species of land birds were known to live on the island. Barbara A. West wrote, ""Sometime before the arrival of Europeans on Easter Island, the Rapanui experienced a tremendous upheaval in their social system brought about by a change in their island's ecology... By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population had dropped to 2,000–3,000 from a high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier.""*  


*By that time, 21 species of trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some combination of over-harvesting, over-hunting, rat predation, and climate change. The island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than 3 m (9.8 ft). Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities. One theory is that the trees were used as rollers to move the statues to their place of erection from the quarry at Deforestation also caused erosion which caused a sharp decline in agricultural production. This was exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations as a source of food.*   


*As the island became overpopulated and resources diminished, warriors known as matatoa gained more power and the Ancestor Cult ended, making way for the Bird Man Cult. Beverly Haun wrote, ""The concept of mana (power) invested in hereditary leaders was recast into the person of the birdman, apparently beginning circa 1540, and coinciding with the final vestiges of the moai period."" This cult maintained that, although the ancestors still provided for their descendants, the medium through which the living could contact the dead was no longer statues but human beings chosen through a* ***competition.***  


competition here results in strength and fighting tournaments.

Basically, once humans exhausted the island's natural resources, population dropped 80% in a century, violence erupted and the survival of the fittest kicked in and violent leaders took hold of power.  
And the fact that they were still cutting down the large remaining trees to use as rollers for their stone statues... Could there be a better metaphor for our obsession with status quo?

&#x200B;

I think this holds a lot of the keys to the future.

&#x200B;

Climate change works on a delayed exponential model: due to climate inertia, there is a lag between emissions and temperature increase. That's just like covid where there is a lag between deaths and exponential rise in cases.

&#x200B;

With covid, for every wave, people used the same arguments to whine about lockdown measures: 'cases are only 30k, and deaths are super low!'. Little did they know that mathematically, the slaughter was already a done deal. If people can't see it happening by taking a look out of their window, they refuse to believe it. They rely on hope, God or karma to sort things out so that it all takes a turn for th best.

g6agbq,Movie review and commentary Planet of the Humans,"I published this on Medium [Here](https://medium.com/@ryan44934/planet-of-the-humans-a-documentary-without-hope-399c855913a)

 

A poorly edited documentary about the woes of the green revolution was released for free on Youtube yesterday. You might consider its makers the left of the left, a fringe hating the movement generally loved by the left. Can’t anyone who loves the planet get behind green energy? It appears not. I dislike this documentary about as much as I loved it. It highlights some of what I have been thinking for about three years now. What it did not do was offer solutions, which I will do for you and for the makers of this film. If you were to watch this piece and do nothing further you might feel that we are now completely hopeless. The tech we hoped to save us can’t. Wind turbines, solar panels even hydro all have environmental implications. The truth is, the green energy you might be thinking is going to be ubiquitous will just be a small bit player in a truly verdant future.

I’m going to outline for you problems and, in my view, a few viable solutions. First let’s discuss the film itself. The film is bleak starting with an Earth day celebration narrated by a bore in Gibbs. He found diesel backup at an Earth day celebration. Guess what? Who cares. Small beans. The film then goes on to complain about car manufacturers making electric cars, using the Chevy Volt as a prop because the electricity that fuels them in Lansing Michigan is from coal. My question for the film maker is this: Does he expect everything to change all at once in every city in the world? He probably does, but that isn't possible. I think its OK to build a carrot to force the stick be built. It how things are going to happen, if they happen at all. He should be spending his time talking about what it would take for the nation to electrify vehicular travel, with low or no emissions. It still requires the electric car! Damn him for pooing on real progress that was the Volt. If there is a tragedy in the film it’s that Americans didn’t embrace the Volt in the first place!

I’m going to skip to the ending for a minute. Gibbs tell us at the end of the film what we have to do. Its answer: Use less. What an over simplified, ridiculous and vague cop out of an answer. It IS true that we need to use less, but what does he mean by this? How much less? What’s most important to use less of? How should we power the planet for what we still make in an era of less? Should we just turn off the lights and cars and hospitals and businesses and food production and call it a good run for humanity but it’s time to die now? No answers or hints of answers in this film. This is a problematic ending. It decries use of typical energy sources, then does the same to green energy then offers nothing in its place. The film is not *wrong* but it brings us to place of hopelessness where all things are equally bad.

Things are not equally bad. Solar and wind turbines have merit, and it is more than that of coal. Wind turbines for example pay back their manufacturing cost (in terms of greenness not money) in three years. They last for 20. It’s 17 years of useful green energy. It is however intermittent, and when it isnt provide power natural gas is its backup. Windmill farms do, as the documentary spends a lot of time pointing out, often hurt the environment they are put in by having forests cleard for them or killing apex birds. But again, this film fails to offer an answer. Gibbs could have suggested a changes to the EPA that rates environmental degradation prior to placing wind or solar on the land. It is yet again political will that we need here to provide a holistic framework to place renewables. **We should concurrently be working on truly recyclable plastics for everything, including windmills and solar panels.** We should be working more on long term storage batteries including iron flow, and testing out massive gravity storage application to balance out wind and solar. We should be working on replacements for chemicals used in turbines that are extremely environmentally unfriendly like Sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6, which has a CO2 equivalent of 117 tonnes of carbon ([That is not a misprint](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49567197)) per windmill if emitted. Still these technologies are better than a coal plants which release about two billion tons of CO2 per year. **Remember energy isn't free and steps into the future will involve compromise.**

Next, the problems of accountability shown in the film.

‘Green’ energy is nuanced and we don’t have a standardized system of accounting for what is and isn’t worthwhile. What this documentary revealed was just how far corporate tentacles have reached into the organisations we think untouchable. Examples provided are the Sierra Club, Al Gore and Tesla. However these people and organisations who have put environmentalism on the dinner table menu never get a chance to defend themselves. This film is part hit piece and the director isn’t happy with anyone, including himself.

What Gibbs seems to find most frustrating apart from humanity’s existence is biomass energy. Biomass is difficult to define because it can mean many things. The US energy administration defines biomass as energy derived from burnt wood chips, agriculture waste, food garbage or manure including sewage. This invites an important distinction under the green umbrella. There is renewable and there is low carbon. Burning wood for energy is nice by a campfire but one of the worst ways possible to power an industrialized nation. High resource use, high carbon emission, low energy density, particulate emissions, but yes renewable.

Moving onto solutions Because this movie doesn’t have any. (Warning US centric)

Solution 1) Electrifying everything, especially cars. I am a believer in the series hybrids such as the Volt and this is why I was so upset to see it used as a foil. You can use a lot less cobalt in a battery that is ⅙ the size of a typical Tesla. The Volt had a 50 mile battery and when depleted and gas generator kicked on to power the battery. Most people drive less that 30 miles per day, and would decrease gas use by 70–80% for most people. This is like getting a gasoline car that got 115+ miles per gallon. The Volt could have been the perfect transition vehicle into a more electrified nation. We build chargers everywhere and learn to build better batteries with less rare metals which are toxic, and mined under horrific conditions.

Solution 2) Have a commission that provides both a general rating and a specific rating to a given technology and what can be done to improve it. These ratings should be simple enough for the public to understand them. For example a rating of 1 is the ideal green energy and coal is a 10 where does X technology fall? And on the site that is being proposed, does it change this number. Is this old, slow growth forest move a 3 technology to a 6? Keep the rating measure simple even if what going into the rating is complex. This would help keep things like biomass from seeming friendly when it isn’t.

Solution 3) Solar, wind and hydro where it makes sense while we continue to work on underlying tech that would alleviate the need for natural gas as backup. I feel that solar and wind belongs in rural places that are too small to economically connect to larger electrical grids. So what do I think should power most other things, see solution 4.

Solution 4) Nuclear. The film touches on nuclear for such a short time (about 10 seconds) that you get the feeling that the word nuclear alone is supposed to be enough to scare off any one willing to watch such a film as ‘Planet of the Humans’. What I am calling for is Gen 4 walk away safe Nuclear. Such as what Bill gates has spent a billion of his own dollars [developing.](https://www.terrapower.com/) In addition developing small modular nuclear reactors in the realm of 200–300MWe per unit. Why?

Nuclear is the greenest power source, even compared to wind and solar, [LINK](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nuclear-less-co2-than-solar-hydro-biomass/). It is the least deadly power source [LINK](https://www.statista.com/statistics/494425/death-rate-worldwide-by-energy-source/). It is dispatchable (non variable), meaning it doesn’t require an entire extra natural gas backup plant to exist when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Did you know that natural gas companies LOVE wind, are backing and promoting solar and wind energy? For every solar setup we build we are committing ourselves to 20–30 years of a wind/NG combination. It is much better than a coal plant, but much worse than a nuclear plant.

Further, we don’t have to overbuild nuclear energy. To have wind and solar power the US without NG we would have to massively over build capacity (not within any economic reason) [LINK](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/radical-idea-get-high-renewable-electric-grid-build-way-more-solar-and-wind-needed). Nuclear is nearly plug and play and doesn’t require the massive infrastructure overhaul that 100% solar and wind would require.

Downsides of nuclear before the commentators get to it, and no neither the pro or con list is exhaustive.

Cost: Nuclear is very expensive up front. There are plenty of ways to mitigate this but in the end there will always be truth to it. When energy experts consider any form of energy they use LCOE (levelized cost of energy). Nuclear is very competitive in terms of $/kwh, but it requires large upfront investment. What we need is the *ideal* large and small reactors developed with the help of multiple governments and companies. One design for a large plant and one design for a small plant. Then those governments that developed can build it out for free. Ideal designs would be walk away safe design (no meltdown possible), molten salt reactors (efficient, non pressurized reactors), using uranium waste as fuel. That’s right, these plants can eat spent nuclear waste (an over simplification read more about that and more [here](https://www.wired.com/story/next-gen-nuclear/)). Side note: Forget thorium (which has a huge fanboy club), it’s not needed and ultimately has similar problems to uranium. You can still make weapons from it, you can make salt reactors with uranium, and yes I want to use waste uranium — not dig up new thorium.

Nuclear proliferation: Simply put, the biggest contributors to global warming already have nuclear weapons. If in the future these plants made it to countries without nuclear weapons I believe they should be heavily defended but that’s a concern for the distant problem that I wish we had now.

Nuclear waste: The plants I’m espousing use nuclear waste to fuel themselves. Also, consider this. All nuclear waste in the USA right now could fit into one super Walmart. Bam! It is so much more manageable than detractors want you to think and comes down to the one thing I’ve kept mentioning in this article: Political willpower.

One day nuclear power won’t be the best option. We may finally develop a perfect batteries for short, medium and long term energy storage solutions. Fusion might finally work. Maybe clean coal becomes more than a figment of republicans’ imagination (ha!). But for now it is by far the best option we have. We can begin building out our best iterations and keep developing the ideal solution which could be ready for massive implementation in 10 years such as a Terrapower module. It has already been 10 years since the Great recession, what the hell have we been waiting for, a pandemic?

For us to tackle global warming, in time or at all, it is going to take brutal pragmatism. That is why I believe this film, Planet of the Humans, is helpful. While it is unnecessarily hopeless it does convey that not all things are what we think they are. Green isn’t always green, it’s complicated. Right now while trillions of dollars are being spent to support the world during a pandemic is the perfect time to pivot to a long overdue clean future. It might be the only time until another catastrophic event arrives, approximately 10 years from now, making it 40 years later than we should have acted in the first place to save the Earth.",1587592969.0,11,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/g6agbq/movie_review_and_commentary_planet_of_the_humans/,powering buildings,Positive

Here's the podcast transcript:

Welcome to Beyond Money, the podcast where we discuss the technologies and businesses changing the world.  Today, we’re going to talk about Climate Change, the greatest problem humanity has ever faced.  A problem of our own creation, climate change will impact every single person’s life on this planet.  From the food that we eat, to the water that we drink, these basic necessities as well as our surrounding environments will be dramatically impacted in the future as climate change progressively continues to worsen over the coming decades.  Despite this, there’s a saying I’ve heard numerous times regarding capitalism and business.  “The greater the challenge, the greater the opportunity.”  Despite the enormous challenge and danger Climate Change presents us with, I believe it will be our greatest opportunity to create a beautiful, sustainable, and prosperous future, for all. 

Climate change isn’t a problem in the distant future, it’s a problem that our planet is dealing with right now. I’ve personally witnessed my home town experience the greatest flood it’s seen in over 100 years.  My college of Indiana University just faced one of the worst flash floods in over a century, and we all witnessed the devastating wildfires in Australia in 2020.  Climate change isn’t just wildfires in California or rising sea levels, it’s more extreme and unpredictable weather all over the globe.  It’s no surprise we’re seeing the worst wildfires globally ever, at the same time as the worst flooding ever.  In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, my hometown, I’ve witnessed in the middle of December temperatures rapidly fluctuate from 75 degrees and sunny one day to 20 degrees and snowing the next day.  75 degrees in Pittsburgh during the middle of December may sound great, but these extremely volatile weather patterns disrupt natural migration and growth cycles for both plants and animals. These extreme, unpredictable weather patterns will only continue to get worse as the amount of carbon in the atmosphere increases.  The global climate is a delicate balance, and as we continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere, we will slowly destabilize this balance.   We must all, working together, take drastic and rapid action in order to combat climate change.  We cannot be the first generation of people to provide our children with a worse future than ourselves.  I believe that all of us on Earth, working as one united people, can conquer climate change.  Climate change is too grand of a problem for any one nation to solve.  We must all be in this together, because if we aren’t, then the paradise we call Earth will quickly destabilize into a wasteland.

Fixing climate change will require dramatic, radical changes to the way we live on this planet, and it all starts with the very fuel that powers our world, oil. Oil and fossil fuels are destroying our planet, and it’s all because of the way we power our homes, cities, ships, cars, and planes.  While fossil fuels are incredibly energy dense, the way we power our planet must change.  Oil and natural gas still make up over 80% of the US’s energy consumption, and globally, fossil fuels make up 79% of total energy production. However, despite much of the energy production currently being fossil fuels, this is rapidly changing.  In 2019, wind and solar energy represented 72% of all energy capacity installed, meaning the vast majority of companies expanding electricity generation are choosing renewables over fossil fuel alternatives.  This can all be explained by one thing: cost. The cost to produce energy from solar, wind, and other renewables has greatly reduced over the past decade.  For example, the cost to generate electricity from solar energy has dropped from $359/Mwh in 2009 to just $40/Mwh in 2019, an 80% decrease in just 10 years.  Solar went from being the most expensive option to the least expensive option, all within a decade.  Electricity from wind has dramatically lowered in cost as well, with costs decreasing 70% over the same time period from $135/Mwh to $41/MwH. Now, it is cheaper on average to build solar and wind energy, versus ANY other type of energy.  

Now why did this happen?  Max Roser, from Our World in Data, explains: 

“The costs of fossil fuels and nuclear power depend largely on two factors, the price of the fuel that they burn and the power plant’s operating costs.  Renewable energy plants are different: their operating costs are comparatively low and they don’t have to pay for any fuel; their fuel doesn’t have to be dug out of the ground, their fuel – the wind and sunlight – comes to them. What is determining the cost of renewable power is the cost of the power plant, the cost of *the technology itself*.” 

As we can now see, it’s all about economies of scale. As we’ve scaled solar and wind energy production, it’s driven down the cost of those technologies, driving further economies of scale and therefore further demand.  More solar or wind deployment leads to prices falling, which in turn leads to more applications for solar or wind energy, which then leads to further demand and deployment of these technologies.  This positive feedback loop continues indefinitely.  To see this positive feedback loop and it’s dramatic impact, we can simply zoom out and look at the cost of renewable technologies over the long term.  For example, the price of solar modules has decreased 99.6% since 1976.  How dramatic is that! 99.6%!  This is the magic of technology and economies of scale, more growth leads to lower costs, which leads to even more growth.

Now while solar and wind technology are rapidly decreasing in cost, they still have one fundamental flaw.  The sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow.  How do we solve this problem, as electricity demand globally is constant, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Fortunately, we have some of the smartest minds working to solve this problem.  Tesla has developed cutting edge battery storage products which will store solar or wind energy in lithium-ion batteries, completely changing everything.  Now, solar energy generated during the day can be stored in these batteries, and distributed for use during night, even when the sun isn’t shining.  A combined solution of solar and wind energy generation with battery storage, now makes this energy available for use, 24/7.  And as battery costs continue to decline, the prospect of such a system only grows more appealing.  This is what gives me hope for the future.  These incredible technologies are becoming more accessible to more regions of the world due to these steep cost declines and fundamental improvements. With the fundamental problem of solar and wind energy now solved with a battery-based energy storage solution, there’s no reason why the entire world can’t be powered by sustainable energy. I’m not saying shut down all fossil fuel plants tomorrow, however, as this would cause a societal collapse.  We still rely on fossil fuels for critical infrastructure in the United States and around the globe.  What I’m truly advocating for is an accelerated push towards sustainable technology, as fast as possible, from everyone.  The technology is ready and here today, it’s all a matter of scaling production and distributing it to the world.

Now obviously scaling such a solution will require an immense amount of resources, talent and capital, yet I believe it will get done since this will be the world’s greatest economic opportunity. There is simply too much money to be made by building and deploying sustainable energy technology, as everyone on the planet will need it. The amount of jobs required to scale production, distribute, and deploy sustainable energy technology will be immense.  I believe scaling sustainable energy technology will generate tens of millions of jobs globally, with many of those jobs being in developing countries.  As these countries modernize and industrialize, they will demand sustainable energy solutions since they will all have rapidly increasing demand for electricity as their populations grow and standards of living rise. Solar and wind plants combined with batteries will be cheaper than any fossil fuel solution, so it’ll be a no-brainer to use sustainable technology solutions in these countries.  All of these regions will need an immense amount of people to distribute and maintain these technologies, which will help the economies of these regions. When fully distributed, sustainable energy technology will bring a rapid expansion of cheap electricity to regions that have never had power.  People in these regions will be able to have access to the internet, clean drinking water, and sanitary food for the first time.  Think of the innovation that will result globally, with these tools now at everyone’s disposal.  It makes it a lot easier to innovate and solve problems when you don’t have to find clean drinking water and food every day.

Now climate change isn’t all about the carbon emissions, although it plays the greatest role.  Our impact can be felt in other ways, such as the fertilizers we use in our agricultural fields and the deforestation activity we engage in to support growing crops, livestock, and other activities. Runoff from our agricultural fields into our rivers and oceans is killing huge amounts of marine life, and all ecosystems are delicate and connected.  Having a diverse ecosystem of life on the planet is crucial to our long-term survival, as diversity of life creates a robust global ecosystem that provides us with a variety of nutrients from various plants and animals.  When we destabilize this delicate global ecosystem, things quickly get out of hand.  Humanity’s overfishing has caused many marine ecosystems to collapse, dramatically reducing the amount of fish in the ocean, as many fish rely on other fish or marine plants to survive.  Fertilizers and other chemicals from human activities are also causing many coastal reef ecosystems to collapse, dramatically reducing the amount of food available for other marine life as well as ourselves.  We must figure out a way to sustainably manage our marine ecosystems, or else this trend will continue to worsen.  As the global population continues to rise, the importance of this will only increase, as we will have to balance an ever-increasing demand for food with a smaller and smaller pool of marine life.  If we eat all of the food in the ocean, we will starve.   We must find a balance.  Every ecosystem on the planet relies on another ecosystem, whether its bears relying on fish from the ocean or plants relying on bees to pollinate them.  As we disrupt this balance by destroying ecosystems, our problems will only continue to worsen.  Luckily for us, innovative companies are coming up with creative solutions to help us with our ever-growing food and protein demands.  We’ll dive deeper into this in the next podcast.

In conclusion, despite the immense problem climate change poses and the deteriorating situation currently, I believe humanity will perservere.  With the world’s greatest talent flocking to companies that solve this problem, I believe in human ingenuity and the belief that anything is possible.  I personally will be taking my talents to a company that fights climate change, as I see no greater cause to fight for.  A future where the Earth is a lush, green paradise, where we breathe clean air and live sustainably is a future I desire, and I strive to help create it. We must attack the problem of climate change from all fronts, not just one vector.  We must eat sustainably, power our homes sustainably, travel sustainably, and manage our surrounding ecosystems sustainably.  Sustainable technologies are rapidly declining in cost and improving, and I believe we will do all of these things. Despite the tough road ahead, I believe that we will prevail, and create a beautiful future as a result.  Don’t lose faith, don’t give up.  Help is on the way, and we will conquer climate change.

I hope you enjoyed the show, and found today’s podcast entertaining and informative.  If you enjoyed the topic of climate change, you’re in for a treat, as the next podcast will dive deep into a company that’s revolutionizing how humanity consumes protein, and saving the planet as a result.  Stay tuned.  We also discussed mostly solar and wind technology solutions, but nuclear is equally if not more promising long-term.  A future podcast will cover innovations in this space and what the future of nuclear power looks like.  Trust me, it’s beyond exciting.

16ascro,Looking for a Climate Change charity,"I'm passionate about combating climate change but have grown disillusioned with many charitable organizations claiming to address the issue. I am hoping for recommendations for a charity that aligns with as many of my concerns as possible. Ideally, I am looking for a charity that:

* Nuclear Energy: Supporting a sustainable energy mix, without fear-driven rejection of nuclear energy.
* Renewable Realism: Acknowledging limitations of renewables like solar and wind, emphasizing sustainable manufacturing, energy storage, and cleaner use of current infrastructure.
* Intermittency Issues: Recognizing the intermittent nature of renewables, the associated grid stability challenges, and the need for fossil fuel backup, which increases emissions.
* Redundant Infrastructure: Awareness of the valid concern that building renewables requires traditional power plants for backup, increasing the financial, resource, and land costs.
* Balanced Approach: Not advocating for the abrupt cessation of oil and gas use but promoting cleaner production and utilization. Recognizing gas power plants can be a lot more environmentally friendly than renewables given the situation.
* Access to Clean Fuel: Focusing on providing clean-burning gas or oil for cooking in biomass-reliant regions, improving public health and reducing deforestation.
* Regulation and Best Practices: Implementing strict regulations and best practices in sourcing and utilizing oil and gas resources, akin to clean energy initiatives in places like Denver.
* Policy Advocacy: Championing policy measures like subsidies for cleaner oil and gas and taxation for dirtier alternatives to incentivizing cleaner production Scientific Foundation: Basing initiatives and advocacy on tangible, science-backed evidence, ensuring rigor in research and analysis.

c8jz5y,Climate Change Company(?),"Okay so I have an idea. I wanted your guys opinion on this and to get this off my chest . But first of all, please excuse any typos, misspellings, and grammatical errors thank you.

I have this idea of a company being started that its sole purpose it’s to try and prevent pollution and reverse damage that’s already been done. A company which uses multiple ways of reducing carbon emissions and pays their employees in a different way. It would provide the employees a place of living and provide necessities like water, the company would be self-sufficient where there are jobs broken up into different areas such as resource gathering departments(which would focus on gathering water, planting and harvesting food, and such), science and engineering departments(creating and building new or more efficient ways to improve carbon emission reduction and such), and other areas like construction crew, safety crew, etc. A company which grows by hiring people who are willing to do work for a place to live, eat, grow, and help make a difference in this world. Obviously the pay would not be limited to only residency and basic necessities. Many of the jobs on its company would include, creating energy from people power such as riding a bike/treadmill generator or planting trees and such. Eventually this company would grow so big it would become almost a city.

5680ee,"Is the worst case extinction or ""merely"" the mass deaths of poor nations?","There's the following reddit post that is rather alarmist : (link 0)

In summary, 

a.  The 2 degree C ""target"" will not be met _1_

 b.  The additional heating would have dramatic effects : mass droughts, extreme weather, portions of the equator uninhabitable _1_

c.  The author mentions a ""runaway"" effect being a real risk, from melting methane clathrates and such, that in theory could eventually make the earth uninhabitable.  He also mentions that ""nothing humans could do could stop it"". _1_

On the other side of things :

  a.  Israel has recently brought online desalination plants that produce 1000 liters/58 cents from ocean water.  Droughts are irrelevant.  _2_

  b.  It is possible to mass farm inside modular farms instead of needing arable land.  If the modular farms were made on a large enough scale, they would be cheap.  They could be made to support robotic harvesting and plant tending. _3_

   c.  It is probably possible/straightforward to genetically engineer algae so that a warehouse full of grow tubes could feed a city.  _4_

   d.  Buildings made properly from armored concrete sections in strong shapes are basically immune to the most extreme weather the planet can create. _5_

   e.  Not all the earth will be hit by megastorms or be uninhabitable.  Greenland, Canada, Antarctica would become more habitable.  

As for runaway warming being unstoppable : really?
   a.  You could inject sulfur dioxide in the upper atmosphere _6_

   b.  You could inject some kind of mirror like lighter than air plastic _6_

   c.  You could build an e-mag launcher and launch packages of thin mirrors.  Circularize orbit with ablative laser propulsion, the laser coming from a station.  Shade off enough of the sun's light to fix the problem permanently with mirrors in a high, stable orbit.   _7_

So it would still be bad.  The natural world that we've gotten to enjoy?  All those rainforests and coral reefs and yellowstone national park?  Gone like the dodo birds.  Future generations would have to settle for museum specimens and pictures.  And yes, any nation that can't afford artificial farms and hardened buildings and nuclear/solar power is going to probably end up starving or dying of thirst or wars.

rxxgsk,Population Density...?,"So, I came across this [(map)](https://twitter.com/hannahker11/status/1329163888680706050?s=20) by Hannah Ker based up the [(data set)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/lulc-human-modification-terrestrial-systems)... which made me think...what are the possible solution to this?

Increase population density, to the point where humans are interacting with less than 1% of overall landmass. That would allow nature to rebuild itself, with a little help, replanting and what not. While maintaining a decent quality of life, for humans ...

In order to accomplish this...we would require 100 cities with 100 million people each, with a population density between Manhattan and Tokyo - vertical factory farming, hydroponic farming, aeroponic farming, and fish farming, desalination, free efficient public transportation, powered by renewable energy and nuclear…connected by hyperloops or bullet trains.

This will take time and stages....So, the first two cities to be built would be connecting Sudan or Somalia, to Mauritania or Western Sahara, via hyperloop. This is mostly for freight not people. Allowing shipping companies a cheaper alterative to the suez canal or horn of africa, while reducing the pollution. The hyperloop would require solar on top, and trees to be planted on either side in order to reduce damage from sand, this also creates carbon sink.

Those first two cities and next 30-40 Cities would allow us to raise, 3-4 billion people out of extreme poverty while reducing their overall carbon, pollution, and impact on environment. building these cities it allows us to better organize, maintain, and redevelop key infrastructure for recycling, sewage treatment, and trash.

In order to build these in any manageable time, and allow for reasonable accommodations, we would need to factory prebuilt mix use skyscrapers; retail/commercial on ground floors, office/commercial mid, residential top. Each building would be one acre footprint and require space for 1,0000 people. So the city would be 100,000 buildings on a 100,000 acres without industrial, which would be about 160 sq miles per city. So 100 cities at 160 sq miles = 16,000 sq miles out of 57,308,738 square miles of earth...which is .02% .... So if we are allowing up to 1% of the earth to be used, this allows .98% of the earth or ~557,087 sq miles to be used for; vertical factory farming, hydroponic farming, aeroponic farming, fish farming, desalination, renewable energy sources, nuclear energy, and other industries.

How much do you think it would cost?

20 billion a year for the next 60 years?

or how about 100 billion per year for 50 years?

you know what your right! 250 billion per year for 80 years....absurd right?

Just American's give ~$456 Billion per year to 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 organizations per year...

If you actually read this whole thing, I appreciate it...I am going to go put on my tin foil hat, and wait for the replies telling me I am crazy for writing this wall of text...just some idea I have rattling around in my head, after watching documentaries on Venus Project, Masdar City Project, and Mars City...

zk9fmb,Can we design and build more nuclear power plants in the USA?,"Hi I’m new to this sub and am looking for some discussion about nuclear power plants to combat climate change. It seems like producing clean electricity “fast” (it will take several decades) is the best way to fight greenhouse gases (from oil and fossil fuel burning).  If we move from gas cars to electric ones they will still need to get electricity to charge them which will either come from solar panels on your roof or from power plants.  
Nuclear has a few drawbacks but it seems like that the pros outweigh the cons in safe, clean, energy that doesn’t hurt the environment all things considered.  
The technology has advanced considerably in the past several decades and there is a company that is designing “micro” nuclear power plants for small towns and communities (its still in development).  
Is there obvious flaws in promoting nuclear power?  If the world is going to end soon what are we waiting for?  This seems like the fastest way to stop increasing greenhouse gasses then say banning gas cars and imposing harsh travel restrictions or something of the sort. It seems incredibly low chance of replacing all transportation with electric cars and buses in the next 50 years and (you still need to produce the electricity somehow).
What’s stopping us from greatly increasing nuclear energy?  We can increase our nuclear energy and then slowly decommission them as we increase our solar and wind majority.  
There’s so much “climate change awareness” in the media and I haven’t heard anything about doing “great affecting” things to combat it.
I read a pew research study and most people polled are neutral on the topic. Neither for or against. Why? It seems like a great opportunity!

qn1r0n,Powering Europe with solar panels in the Sahara?,"A question fo the enlightened re solar power:

&#x200B;

In Europe, we get most of our fossil fuel sources of energy from far away (Nat gas from Russia and Middle East, oil from ME, Asia and the US). most comes by tanker, some of it by pipeline.

&#x200B;

It's also a fact that wind and solar energy in Europe won't be enough to power the continent on their own: some months there is no wind, some summers there is no sun etc...

&#x200B;

On the other hand, just to the south of Europe, we have Africa, and in particular, the Sahara. 

&#x200B;

Why can't we just build a fuck ton of solar panels in the middle of the Sahara (in fact, in the south, as the more south you go, the more you solve the problem of lower sun energy in the winter months), and convey the electricity all the way to Europe?

&#x200B;

I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here. But if we do it with fossil duels, why not with electricity?

xa2j3b,Climate change and how to solve it NOW,"I was at a science conference (something my university does yearly) and I chanced upon a conversation with nuclear power scientist - and we had a long conversation about how we (as individuals - student and scientist) could potentially stop climate change. 

The basic argument that they had was that, if enough fusion power plants were built - they could power the entirety of the globe. Fusion power plants being: using the heat from nuclear fusion processes to produce electricity.

Getting rid of all the non-renewable energy.  

I asked how much you'd need to invest - around 200 billion. ONLY 200 BILLION DOLLARS and you can stop climate change! Imagine that ! Some people have more money than that, and they could solve it by building these plants. So if countries came together and actually decided to do something, they could solve it! 

However, it won't happen (the scientist said) as there's too many fake information about fusion power reactors - and the media make it seem that its basically the same as nuclear bombs - which it isn't. 

That's my solution to climate change - change the information accessibility and spend 200 billion dollars and save the world. However it still takes time to change peoples opinions.

1. Censorship - it's hard to find any open discussion where concerns are addressed.
2. Alarmists & past climate science - We were supposed to die like 7x already.

&#x200B;

My goal is to provide evidence against valid arguments from skeptics, along with a debunked list of exaggerations from alarmists to give a well-rounded look at the issue. This will help pull people away from both spectrums by validating and addressing their concerns.

&#x200B;

Denial <--------------------**Truth/Science**\--------------------->alarmists/fatalists

&#x200B;

I need your help to find arguments AGAINST climate change/climate action. A recorded debate between thought leaders on both sides would be great to start. Thanksgiving arguments from you or your uncle are also appreciated.

&#x200B;

Here's the current list of counter-arguments/concerns I've collected:

**Methodology** \- Flaws in the climate science

* Climate cycles - The earth naturally gets warmer and colder in cycles. The current science accounts for this by averaging decades, while climate cycles involve periods anywhere from 60 to 20,000 years.
* The sun - The giant nuclear fusion reactor in the sky is changing and causing warming
* Volcanoes & natural emitters - Volcanoes release more CO2 than humans.
* Demonization of CO2 - CO2 is a trace gas, 0.038% of the atmosphere. How can it have any influence on global climate at this level? How can we 100% link CO2 to global warming?
* Natural absorption - Doesn't the carbon cycle balance itself out? More CO2 = more CO2 absorption.

&#x200B;

**Data -** Temperature recording not reliable

* Station quality - Temperature stations in the U.S. are inaccurate.
* Homogenization -  historical records have undergone adjustments to account for changes in observation practices. Critics were suspicious of these adjustments.
* Urban heat island - Urban areas are warmer than rural areas. Critics argue warming recorded was actually due to increased urbanization rather than climate change
* Station selection bias - Studies only used a small sample of station data (to get results they want)

&#x200B;

**Confidence in Projections** \- Scientists are still debating some projections

* How much warming? - We agree on warming, but there is wide disagreement on how much warming will occur in the future, and if it may have some positive aspects.
* Warming isn't bad - 'We stopped the next ice age'

&#x200B;

**Sentiment/Politics** \- Climate Change is a democrat control tool

* Rigged studies - Democrats can make the 'science' say whatever they want it to
* Donor interests - studies are being paid for by biased groups, making the findings unreliable
* Rights - The government is using 'climate change' as a control tool to abuse our rights
* Alarmists - Countless number of predictions that never came true

&#x200B;

**Religion** \- Climate Change challenges religious beliefs

* God has a plan - Earth's temperature is God's divine will. Leave it up to a higher power.

&#x200B;

\---------Actions---------

Climate Action Plans are not feasible.

**Alternative energy**

* Wind & Solar - High startup cost, unreliable (70-80% downtime), take up lots of land, increased electricity prices, waste of materials, short life-span, no plan for waste
* Nuclear - Risky, bad public perception due to historical events

&#x200B;

**Reduce Emissions**

* Electric Vehicles - Lots of precious metals, limited battery life & waste, we couldn't supply the whole world with EVs.
* COWS??? - 1/3 of emissions come from livestock. We all have to go vegan to stop global warming? Feed cows garlic?
* Energy efficient buildings -

&#x200B;

**'Obvious' solutions**

* Plant more trees

17s64jo,"How to determine if batteries (plus wind and solar and grid energy transfer) are better for replacement of fossil fuel grid energy than nuclear, or if nuclear is better than batteries","About a month or so ago, I posted about the merits of solar and wind compared to nuclear.

While I asserted that wind and solar are generally better than nuclear, I conceded that nuclear is better than batteries (in conjunction with wind and solar) in terms of ""capacity"" and reliability.  Specifically, for example, solar with tracking (and batteries) is generally estimated to produce 5x the wattage of nuclear (see source below).

[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table\_8.2.pdf](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table_8.2.pdf)

I noted that Nickel Iron (NiFe) battery technology is superior to what is currently being used, which is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePh), or other forms of Lithium battery technology, in that it is a higher return on investment, lasts much longer, can be easily repaired, is recyclable, and does very very little damage to the environment (basically negligible in the frame of reference of general battery technology).  The noteworthy downsides of NiFe are that it requires water to be added every few months, but this can be easily automated, and that the initial cost is high, but this would be negated entirely upon mass production (since the design is far simpler), and when comparing to a nuclear grid system they are likely to be cheaper, but it depends on the situation.

Credible sources consistently state that nuclear energy is of roughly equal environmental damage to solar and wind using Lithium batteries.  If Nickel Iron batteries are utilized, wind and solar would therefore be cleaner than nuclear.  Rooftop solar is also under-utilized to an extreme and should be absolutely subsidized as rooftop solar has no footprint (takes no land to use).

In the discussion on that prior post, something was brought to my attention, which in hindsight and when trying to summarize it now in introducing the issue, seems simple, but I think the issue is more complex than it at first will appear.  Obviously, solar and wind aren't reliable.  Batteries need to be used to store energy for downtimes.  Now lets say we get no wind and lots of clouds for some variable number of consecutive days.

Thus we can write a formula to tell us at what point the cost of batteries to account for solar and wind downtime will equal the cost to build a nuclear plant.  We can look at historical anomalies of having no wind and lots of clouds for consecutive days.

""Grid transfer"" (something I don't know much about) can also be used.

Some questions come to mind.

Namely would it be practical to use nuclear to provide a baseload of minimum required electricity during known downtimes (specifically the night, but also accounting to some degree for batteries and wind)?  This would depend on the answer to whether it is of roughly same cost to build a ""small"" nuclear plant to supply a minimum baseload of electricity at night as it would be to build a larger nuclear facility to power the entire needs of the grid.

Again, solar with tracking and batteries produce 5x the wattage per dollar invested compared to nuclear.  Fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible - we are all in agreement on that.  It is prudent to be cognizant of how resources are spent, to the degree that is practical.

I believe it should not be difficult to compare the cost of nuclear to the cost of batteries needed for downtimes, and make the best decision.

Again, fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible.  I see absolutely no excuse for not replacing FF for production of grid energy.

Edit:

Let me try to restate the issue again.

The issue is that some people have argued that because solar and wind are inherently unreliable, and nuclear is inherently reliable, and because we would need enough nuclear to power the grid during solar and wind downtime anyway, we might as well go all in on nuclear.  This is somewhat oversimplified, because it does not include batteries.  With batteries, you can go without solar or wind for as long as you have watt-hours in the batteries.

This post is intended to be about the issue in the above paragraph.

My question is what the difference in cost would be between building a nuclear facility that can produce the minimum needs during downtime of solar (i.e. at night) and wind, and the cost to build a nuclear facility that can power the grid during the times when there is the highest need.

We have to determine which of the two options is better:

1. Build a small nuclear plant to power the grid at night, and then use solar and wind and batteries to make up the difference.
2. Go all in on nuclear.

I tried to provide a general guide in the post on how to answer that, as it depends, obviously, on the weather of the place where the facilities are being constructed.  If you only have 10 cloudy days a year, then you only need enough batteries to compensate for that.  If you regularly get 100 consecutive cloudy days a year, then you can calculate how much batteries you would need and compare it to the cost of nuclear.  If you regularly get constant winds when it's cloudy, then you can factor that in as well.",1699629367.0,0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/17s64jo/how_to_determine_if_batteries_plus_wind_and_solar/,powering buildings,Positive

10uwdvq,Thoughts on burning waste for energy?,"With the mountains of trash cluttering the planet, surely we could use it to produce energy.

We were at a time when printing money was the solution to everything, so I asked why not print some more to build a waste-burning facility.

Surly the energy produced would offset the initial cost.

Not to mention the jobs available in building and maintaining such a facility.

Lastly, there is the issue of the pollutants from burning waste. I recently learned about direct air capture (DAC), so why not slap one on the facility? 

energy cost? 

There is an almost unlimited supply of trash to burn, so please tell me why I’m stupid/wrong about this idea other than the fact that I have 0 power and my opinion means very little to those who do.

16cueie,Just spitballing...,"I got yet another news alert about a storm ""expected to develop into a Category 5 hurricane"" and that got me thinking.

Many people think that a lot of the difficulty of dealing with climate change (in terms of mitigating and preventing it, rather than merely reacting to weather events) involves communication, both of the science and of the gravity of the real-world results and urgent need for seemingly outrageous modification of our collective behavior. I think an important step in this direction would be to eradicate the familiar nomenclature of storm severity and replace it with something more meaningful in real-world terms, something more useful in both reacting to weather events and comprehending the scale and scope of the underlying problem of AGW.

The conventional ""category"" system (the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind scale) was developed by meteorologists and is based on a storm's maximums sustained wind speed. While this is a useful measure of potential damage to residential infrastructure, it is both banal and inaccurate, in real terms. It is so dated it borders on archaic, and not nearly precise enough to mean anything more than that a hurricane will be ""really big"" in practical terms. It doesn't take into account that so-called ""hundred year storms"" are now occuring more than once a decade. And the Fujita Tornado Damage scale has essentially the same problem. Both seemed like good ideas in times past, focusing as they do on the potential impact on individual houses, but neither takes into account the even more important issues of how widespread the damage will be, and how much ancillary catastrophe (from flooding, damage to infrastructure rather than individual buildings, and similar issues) results from a truly huge storm. Both ""top out"" at a conventional level of ""the worst that (used to be) normally possible and anything even worse than that"".

So here's my suggestion. I believe we (meaning they, the people who deal with such things professionally, particularly NOAA and perhaps the IPCC) should develop a new approach to reporting the potential severity and impact of hurricanes, typhoons, tornados, etc. It should work like this: develop a formula (the details are largely irrelevant, so long as it is the same formula for all events of a given type) that takes into account direct effects, such as wind damage and rainfall, as well as resulting devastation (damage to infrastructure, including houses, utilities, industry, and transportation, and lasting impact on the environment) and also *real effect* (death, injury, and dislocation of human beings). Rank the most severe storms in our scientific record using this formula (this 'ranking' approach is why the details of the formula are irrelevant) and identify the worst ten, or worst hundred, such weather events. Then, when a new weather event is threatening to cause drastic affects on people's lives, identify the storm publicly as ""level 10"" (for example: equivalent to the tenth worst event of that type) or ""level 1"" (equal to the worst such storm), including, when applicable, by name. To hear that there is a ""Category 5 hurricane approaching"" is simply abstract information, causing grave distress to the people who are most worried but not most concerned, and being ignored as just another news alert by everyone else. But to hear that there is ""a level 1 hurricane, comparable to Katrina"", and be told that this isn't just ""wind speed"", but how many thousands of people could well be killed, how many tens of thousands may become homeless, how many billions of dollars it could take to even begin to recover, and have real scientific validity (because while it may be based on projections, these will be measurable projections comparable to more than mere meteorology), might be more than worth the effort. Not just in terms of how people will react to that specific event, but how much they recognize that ***things are not going to start getting better, every year will be worse (on average) than the last, and there is no end in sight until we start making serious efforts to not just limit how much carbon we are sending into the atmosphere with fossil fuels but removing the excess we've already ""desequestered""***. 

I think that ""level 1"" will not be enough, of course, since things will indeed keep getting worse, with ""hundred year storms"" happening more and more frequently, and all storms being just a bit more powerful than they would have been without AGW. We don't want this new ""level"" scale to suffer the same problem that the ""category"" one did, topping out at a ""this or higher"" metric. We should have a 1+ level to indicate a valid expert concensus (from meteorologists, climatologists and other biospheric researchers, and emergency management professionals) that the coming storm may well be worse than any we have seen before. And on top of that, a 1++ level, to identify that this coming catastrophe could be up to *twice* as bad as the worst we've had to deal with, and even a 1+++ to mean that it is expected to be up to three times as bad.

Obviously, the precision of the immediate identification and the reliance on projected damage will be less than what we can produce with the current scales, but as I have already mentioned, the current scales aren't very precise in human terms to begin with. A ""Category 5"" that only hits relatively uninhabited regions is still a ""Category 5"", and only takes wind speed into account to begin with. We need something more practical, and the varience that multiple groups of experts, or individual experts, might have about any particular event will not result in less concern and discussion but more, and provide valuable information that people can intelligently use to learn who knows the most and has the best ability to project these things on an ongoing basis. What is more, the ""scale"" will automatically adjust *without losing efficacy* as it will always be constantly re-assessed against the ten (or hundred) worst storms that have already occured, rather than just an abstract (and not nearly as certain as we pretend) and unchanging equivalency between wind speed and damage to houses and telephone poles.

Obviously, this would require tremendously more work and study than simply maintaining the (insufficient) status quo. And that right there is a prime reason for doing it. We need to do better and we need to do more, all of us, both the experts and the relatively passive audience hearing the proclamations of those experts alike.

l9vfft,I have a couple ideas to help solve the effects of climate change.,"I saw a documentary, ""Our planet"" showing that a large glacier is actually RISING out of the water. Presumably because the heat has either decreased the water pressure, or because the sides are falling off and it isn’t being held into the ground because it's width decreased. Well it came to me that this actually REDUCES sea level height actually because there is now more water filling that space. It also said that Greenland reduces temperatures by reflecting light away.

So here's my two ideas might be a bit strange but idk just a thought.

1. Create large nuclear powered drills that dig deep into safe parts of the earth where there will be the smallest danger/risk of catastrophic volcanic activity. We can use this to decrease the sea level as the water moves in to fill the holes. Around these areas we can put chemoautotrophic bacteria to take care of the hydrogen sulphide.

2. I once saw that someone invented a type of foam that can harden over water and float. Capable of remaining buoyant and supportive of structures on top. I don’t remember what it was called. However we could place large platforms of this material in the ocean, and then place very reflective mirrors or liquid mirrors on top to reflect light. We can add this to the tops of buildings and skyscrapers across the world as well to reflect some light.",1612156031.0,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/l9vfft/i_have_a_couple_ideas_to_help_solve_the_effects/,powering buildings,Positive
pihobw,Go Gang Green!!!,"Climate change/global warming is undoubtedly real. Anyone thinking otherwise probably still leaves cookies out for Santa, or just hasn't ever thought about it and possess a futile IQ. 
We have reasons to believe there was an ice age....so obviously there's been a trend of warming since then. So those who deny the planet is on a warming trend should probably have there tongues and fingers removed to prevent them from sharing any info about anything. 
The natural warming occurrence of the planet has obviously been given a steroidal injection by means of human activity. I believe that should be pretty fn obvious. Im not a researcher or scientist with a lifetime dedicated to finding a cure, so like most people, I'm pretty ignorant. But unlike most, I'm able to admit that. 
Tbh, idk if I'm more terrified by the ""woke"" or ""unwoke"" population. 
Its hard to place blame on the ""unwoke"" older generation of people. All of the blame belongs to some of those fuckers but for the most part I can't blame the majority. I don't care if they still think climate change is fake, Oswald shot JFK, and man has walked on the moon. Its not their fault, they lived an entirely different existence. I've always questioned everything so its hard not to judge them for believing everything they were told, but thats how they were trained from infancy. Do what your parents say. Unfortunately, everyone was brainwashed from the top of society and had no real opportunity to escape that facade. So they've lived a life of being mislead. Sure they could become awaken in today's world and for younger people its easy to say they should. I can say with almost total certainty that when I'm 70-80, (old af), I will have 0 desire to change a lifetime of beliefs while I coast out the rest of my days. Again, its easy for present day me to say old me is an inconsiderate p.o.s., but old me is worn out and very likely tired of things changing. Aside from a few, most everyone I knew is dead, the places I made cherished memories are gone and replaced with concrete and stores. I would find it very hard to put energy towards developing a new way of thinking while I hang on to happy memories that happened under different planetary/societal circumstances. Totalitarian blame deserves to go to prior generations. Ima guess that very few/none of us has ever conversed with those deserving of the blame. 
So next time you talk to someone that is obviously not living in reality, don't get pissed at them and judge the entire slew for what they believe. Personally, I just make an internal note of sympathy on their behalf and go on my way. I don't debate with or try to change what they think. Mainly because I don't waste time and energy on shit void of benefits and also I like the idea of letting people die happy with their beliefs. I can't imagine too many things worse than approaching the light at the end of the tunnel with some serious internal conflicts going on.
My empathy and sympathy pertains to 99% of them that aren't really at fault in the first place and can't really help with improvements anyways. Instead of fighting with and trying to change the 1% able of making change, they just need to be removed from their positions. How? Idk, but energy would be better spent on removal than transitioning them.

Actually, I guess I do know who I find more terrifying. Its not the diminishing group that got put us in this position. Their damage is already done for the most part. 
I am a bit scared of the wokes, though. I love people having the mindset of making things better and conscious of the planet's wellbeing. I like it, (I like it a loht). I like people wanting to become more aware and knowledgeable. I don't like how people think they are better than others just because they have interpreted information they believe is 100% factual. 
Pretty much the only guaranteed fact that exists is that we ultimately don't know shit. We may have evidence suggesting its factual, but how do we know we have all of the evidence? How do we know the evidence has been interpreted correctly? Even if it was, was it correctly/truthfully communicated by those in the know? 
As hard as it is for me to imagine past people just believing what they were told even though they had very little information  accessible to them. Its harder to believe that today people can be so certain about something they read somewhere. I mean I get the psychological reasons, its easy to get on board with something that aligns with what we believe and vice versa. I just feel we as a species should be past those by now. The simple fact that there is probably a completely contradictory side to whatever it is should make people at least stop and think like, hey maybe there is a 1% chance its not how I think, instead of just disregarding the fake news. There's at least 3 sides to every story and that only gets vastly multiplied on the internet. So how are people able to be so certain? 

I'm pretty positive humans are fucking up the planet. I am about as sold on that  as i can get. I'm just not necessarily sold on the reasons that people with hidden agendas say. I'm not suggesting their claims of pollution and emissions are bogus. That shit seems pretty obvious. I don't need to read an intellects article to ""inform"" me. What happens when you sit in a running vehicle in a closed garage? Lightheaded, nasuea, and eventual death. Right? Why would anyone think the world isn't a much, much larger garage? Exactly, so combustion engines are killing us, should be obvious. Many of the things that are supposedly killing the planet seem pretty obvious. You won't find me saying any of it is good and isn't getting momma earth all hot and bothered. 
I graduated from college with a BS, but common sense is far more educational than any university course. It may not produce an expert in any one field, but it does provide knowledge that is widely applicable. It serves as my base information source on most topics and is responsible for the a lot of my actions and beliefs. 
Maybe I'm just a dumb/ignorant farmer that grew up and spent most of my time in the middle of nowhere. Honestly, I was quite shocked when I heard the news that I'm apparently one of the main reasons causing the impending doom. If it weren't for motivatimed agendas I would have never been aware of the devastating consequences of my daily actions. 
I've always been fascinated by and appreciative of the big momma E. Most notably the ground where things grow and the air I breathe. Even as a tike, I was conscious of what humans were doing to her. I would compare the present day way of living and the affects to the wild west days of horses buggies. I wasn't really aware of the magnitude of destruction or anything but I just felt it wasn't as pure of an existence we are living. So anytime I think about the impact of humans, I compare present day with the pre industrial days.
I still have a lot of room for more wokeness to learn how I can quit contributing to killing all of us. But as I await the opening of my eyes I can't help but view things through common sense lenses. 
Im not delusional and believe that farming doesn't have negative environmental effects. I mean, I literally can't think of anything that doesn't for fuck sakes haha. I guess my astonishment upon hearing the news that I'm a horrible being came from the fact that I've never became nauseous or suffered a headache from breathing the air on a farm. My eyes haven't burnt from the hazey cloud hanging around. With wide open Montana being a possible exception, idk if there's a more rural area than where I live. Its literally agriculture for hundreds of miles in every direction before there is any type of substantial mass of people and pavement. If there was an area where the immediate effects of farming were felt, id be in it. So forgive my dumbfoundedness. Anytime I go to a metro area for a few days I can't wait to get back so I can breathe good air again. I realize the detriment can extend beyond the immediate area, but to claim the emissions from farm machinery is a huge problem is beyond ignorant to just fucking stupid. Maybe 40-50 years ago when there were 10 tractors pumping out the black smoke in every field. I'm sure there's an industrial park in one city that produces what all tractors collectively emit. 

Common sense also suggests something I have never seen or heard anyone mention a contributing factor to the world heating up. I've seen the studies showing the correlation of hotter temps and cars over the last 100 yrs. I'm not saying cars don't emit naughty gas. But why doesn't anyone take it a step further? Have you ever seen or heard about the tire problems of 100 yrs ago? I don't guess i really have either. I'm not an expert, but if i had to guess, I'd say they did indeed have tire issues. It wouldn't have been from all the kids uglying up all the streets by burning their tires and leaving black marks everywhere. It would've been from the shitty/rocky/unpaved roads they drove on. If one was to consider every highway, road, and street that is paved, they would realized quite a bit of earth is underneath. Don't forget about everything like parking lots, runways, steel buildings ect. It may not seem like much on the grand scale of things. But you're fucking higher than I've ever been if you don't think the sun beaming off of all of that heat-retaining concrete, asphalt, ect hasnt made things a tad warmer. When I compare today to the way back days, I can't help but feel pretty confident in thinking that the accumulated effect of today's landscape wouldn't play a significant role in the accelerated temperature rise. 
It also probably doesn't help that watering restrictions are causing people to add more rock and artificial turf to their yards. When I was doing landscaping up by the city the grass to not grass ratio was crazy to me. I grew up on a dirt road without any pavement for 8 miles. So going to these ""country houses"" <- was funny to me. First off, I could probably throw a baseball from one spot and hit 30 houses and there were hundreds more lined up past those. Each one had a very small patch of grass in front and one in back maybe twice the size. Nearly everyone had some type of rockscape that equaled the front grass. With a paved street, sidewalks, driveways,  and the house itself I'd guess that maybe 5-10% of land in a neighborhood had living grass or plants. And that's the earthy part of cities aside from a park here and there. Which are completely surrounded by heat-retaining earth-covering materials. 

But i guess educated persons don't see it the same as I do. There will be more natural earth smothered for human luxury next year and the years following.  While experts and wannabe sperts ignore the obviousness of it and direct their blame elsewhere. 

Writing this might have convinced me that this is far more detrimental than just a small factor like I originally believed. Maybe I have too much respect for BIG Momma E and her powers but something tells me she is capable of fixing herself. Im sure its more likely that she would be able to fix herself in terms of the greenhouses gases that originated from within her in the first place. Maybe were putting them out at a rate she can't contend with, maybe she can adapt a quicker method. I think in time she could also overcome the concrete blanket she's getting but not at the rate we keep knitting additional pieces. There's just no fn way she can conjure up that kind of healing power to compete at this pace. 

Maybe I'm way wrong, maybe I'm just defensive and not easily accepting of the never-ending attacks on ag, so I'm fabricating the first alternatives I can think of. I'm not accusing anyone of anything, I believe that as conscious individuals most people are good. At least in their core. Seemingly all to often it can get masked by their greed and ego. 
Genuine planetary concern is becoming more and more prominent and that's a great thing. I just hope everyone can check their hiprocracy at the door and refrain from making attacks towards others without really knowing the reasons for such attacks. 

What would an alien, with no previous knowledge or bias, perceive as being more environmentally toxic if they were to spend a week on a farm and a week in the city? 

I believe there's pretty much only one solution for legitimately reduce the wounds of the ass kicking we've been giving BIG Momma E.    (Aside from a mass depopulation, which wouldn't actually be a solution as much as it would just prolong the consequences of our behavior). 
There are other potential solutions that may come to fruition in the future. But as of today, there's only one solution that I can see for true change to actually happen. Though it'll never happen, not until its far too late and it simply has to happen. 
If every human was a vegan and every vehicle was electric, would the world be saved? I'm pretty sure the answer is no. The destruction might get delayed, but no one knows what the consequences of today's actions will be in fifty years. Unless we find/build something that can make everything us humans need out of thin air, our attempts will be moot. 
Any green movement or vegan agenda won't matter without an extreme societal    change in civilization. But like Ive already said,  that will never happen.  
This is already wayyyyy longer than intended so I'll save my solution for those that are interested. Cause lordy knows this one is long enough, haha. 

Go team BIG Momma E!!!!!


PS: My other initial thought is: Do volcanos that are making new islands in the ocean not have an impact on the water level? Its all just due to the ice caps melting? I mean I did see a guy with some schmancy title before his name say that. He was wearing a suit too so I wanted to believe him.

167d0v0,Is climate change driving the war in Ukraine?," 

Siberia is melting. Could that be what is driving Russia's war on Ukraine?

Climate change is effecting Russia more strongly than other countries because more of Russia is in the permafrost zone. Reports going back to 2005 have discussed the melt, and how it has been effecting the infrastructure across millions of square miles as the ground becomes increasingly unstable. Roads, pipelines, airfields, etc. are being rendered unusable because of it. Wildfires akin to what have been plaguing Canada this year have been burning in Russia for the past several years.

Could that be what is really driving Russia to continue a war that seems to offer no chance of worthwhile success? As climate change progresses, more and more of Russia is becoming less and less habitable and productive due to the melt.

I'm not saying it is the sole factor driving this war, but if the Russian government sees an inevitable loss of productivity across vast stretches of its territory it would explain a lot of why they continue to pursue it. It also would mean that they can't stop or give up the drive for territory, if not in Ukraine then elsewhere. I'm not sure that people have looked at this war in the context of climate change, most views seem to encompass only political and narrow economic reasons for it.

What are the thoughts of the community?

The CCAG report cautions that warming temperatures could be pushing the Arctic toward an “irreversible” tipping point, causing the release of methane and other gases, as well as crumbling infrastructure in Siberia, including dams and a nuclear power plant.  
“The story is simple,” the report concludes. “Climate change is happening faster than anticipated. One consequence—the loss of ice in the polar regions—is also a driver for more rapid global heating and disastrously rapid global sea level rise.”

1gn36i0,Its better for the countries to progress and leave the US behind,"I just read these nice commentaries by scientists, and I think it paints a different picture than the gloom and assumed power the Trump presidency will have over the other countries’ progress I’ve been getting reading some reddit posts.

Of course it’s important and a huge setback Trump will cause, but from reading these points of views, I’m getting a few concepts.

It’s more profitable and cheaper to use sustainable energy than fossil fuels, 

The market is moving towards new energy products like electric vehicles, and even nuclear energy, so whether the US likes it or not, the longer they disengage, the further behind in the market, economy they will be. Just for this its in most countries’ interests to chase energy efficiency. 

The last time Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement, other countries stayed true. With their advancements and with renewable energy having economic incentive, US continues to lose its power and will be left behind. 

Eventually, even if the US was not compliant, the other countries with the majority will be able to slap taxes on us. Europe also has laws on imports to meet requirements for methane, so if we dont conform, we will only lock ourselves out of trade opportunities.

The US already has 10 million jobs in renewable energy compared to only 300k in fossil fuels. Even if Trump opposed green energy, there is naturally more economic opportunity there so regardless the market is going to go there.

cri7pj,We should abolish lawns,"The fact that we still have lawns full of short grass that we methodically mow once a week is a significant contributor to climate change. 

Firstly, by replacing whatever natural vegetation would grow in the area with short grass, we reduce the land's ability to take in CO2. By preventing the grass from growing tall, we significantly reduce the amount of CO2 we keep out of the atmosphere, and prevent native ecosystems from developing. Even if grass grows at the same rate whether it's constantly mowed or not, we could replace lawns with forests to fight climate change.

But secondly, and more importantly, lawn mowing consumes a huge amount of resources. In addition to the CO2 produced by the fossil fuels in lawn mowers (or the equivalent energy cost of electric lawnmowers), fertilizers produce nitrous oxide, a very powerful greenhouse gas.

According to https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa8nan/your-well-manicured-lawn-is-contributing-to-climate-change, a maintained lawn contributes about as much to climate change as a transatlantic flight. If 100 million homes in the US stopped maintaining their lawns, that would put a pretty large dent in total greenhouse gas emissions, and that's not counting planting trees to replace the lawns with forests. It's an area no one seems to be talking about, but it seems like we could get a decent impact just by telling people to stop doing something.",1566020476.0,206,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cri7pj/we_should_abolish_lawns/,fossil fuels,Positive
18qqmck,"We are telling ourselves pretty stories, and it's not helpful"," 

There are a few common stories I see popping up on here and the internet often. ""Renewables are now much cheaper than fossil sources."" 

""We will be net zero by given time frame and get rid of fossil fuels soon""

The unspoken one is that there is nothing else to be done about climate change other than cleaning up the energy system.

**This is NOT a pro-nuclear piece or anti-renewables**. I'm writing this because I think these slightly rose-colored views we give ourselves are harmful. There are many pieces in this puzzle and by not acknowledging blindspots we will overdo some things, underdo others, miss doing certain things entirely, and ultimately get this wrong.

**Fossil fuels are an incredibly tough boss match**. Neither renewables nor nuclear can stand up to it at present time. When we first rip something we need out of the earth, they tend to be bound up in dioxide form, for example, silicon dioxide. In order to get pure silicon out we have to break the silicon dioxide bond with a LOT of thermal energy and need a reductant that it reacts with, carbon. Basically coal is thrown in a 1700 degree celsius furnace with the silicon dioxide to get a pure material out. Feeding in thermal energy is how a lot of stuff is born and that's often also true even when it comes from recylced sources.

This heat energy approaches **1c/kWh.** Looking at coal, its energy density and its commodity price assuming close to 100% efficiency of burning it, the thermal and reductant manufacturing inputs are dirt cheap, this is the birth cradle of our renewables meant to save us, this is what we ultimately have to compete with.

Now if you have a solar system in Germany that produces electricity at say 9 cents per kWh and you feed it back into its own input, a hypothetical electric tungsten resistance furnance heater with some captured carbon source, or green hydrogen. Those new panels are now no longer the price of the first set made by coal, not even close. The silicon ingots already go for barely more than these incredibly cheap energy inputs that were fed in. Even in Saudi Arabia with 2c/kWh solar but only 25% capacity factor, we are not even close. Nuclear in its current form is also not there. Renewables are only cheap, because of the wonder of fossil fuels that were fed in, in the first place.

This means that things do not just get more expensive. Once you shut off the fossil sources at the origin, it all collapses. **Civilizational output drops dramatically.** There is less ""excess"" energy to do all the things that we currently do, such as for example maintain medical and scientific institutions that allow us to adapt in the face of adversity, say inventing the next set of antibiotics when we desperately need will need them.

**This will not be easy, nor will it be fast**. Acknowledging that I think will allow us to make better decisions. There will be a lot of temperature increase. Maybe if we acknowledge that, we can work on making natural ecosystems and its inhabitants more resilient to it. Maybe we could stop growing homogenous factory farm trees for biomass generation that is then lumped in with wind and solar statistics, instead create more mixed tree forests to have higher population and diversity of species that are then more likely to be able to adapt to the climate change.

I don't have the answers, **I am just trying to say there may be some creative things we are missing because we are so narrowed in on this rose-colored story and this single set solution.** 

Maybe we can make the ocean more resilient to climate change by exploding it's fish and whale population through fertiziling it and in the process removing 3-12 billion tons of CO2 annually. https://www.newscientist.com/article/2309262-scientists-want-to-restore-the-oceans-with-artificial-whale-poo/

These things are not getting a lot of attention. We have foregone old environtalism which seemed more rich in its concerns, for narrow climate change focus specifically the energy system. 

Instead we are engaged in flamewars, especially between the pro-nuclear and pro-renewables camps, which is incredibly counter productive, because neither side wants to now look at the limitations of each energy system, and so we can't use them effectively. We can't say for example well why are we putting up panels in Canada, because that would be acknowledging that they are not the perfect energy solution in every single regard. **Engineers design based on tradeoffs which means being aware of BOTH strengths and limitations so that you can efficiently place all the pieces in the right places.**

I think we have to pull on every single lever to get through this. Some clever environmental hacks like described above, continued use of renewables but in a targeted and cost effective manner, yes also immense focus on nuclear, energy efficiency measures such as heat pumps, insulation, etc. The solution has to be diverse to be robust. 

I do think because the energy density of uranium is so unbelievably high we may be able to go much further there, but I do NOT want to go into it here because I don't want to be dismissed as some pro-nuclear shill. As far as I go am pro-nuclear + pro-RE. Maybe we should all be.

I have an Electrical Engineering background but have NOT worked in the energy industry. My Engineering and physics background is a helpful lense but I'm learning from the outside as you all are as well. I am open to being wrong, but please be kind to my ego as we all should be. If I come across as arrogant, I apologize, deep down I'm aware that i'm not smart, **I'm an overevolved ape who can only hold 4 things at a time in his working memory and who has to come together with other overevolved apes in order to figure out how to go up against the black gold that planet Earth baked with hundreds of millions of years worth of solar energy**. I think the best thing we can do to get started, is just being humble and open minded, which really is just saying making ourselves vulnerable and then committing to not attacking others in their now vulnerable state. 

Idk why I even wrote this up lol, maybe it's helpful, probably not.

16a9bcg,Are we as a species screwed?,"China, India and Russia emit 40% of the world’s CO2 emissions on their own (source below). These countries, along with other countries that are still developing, are going to continue to use the cheapest energy sources possible to lift as many of their people out of poverty as possible. But without cuts from these nations, any other CO2 cuts will have marginal benefits to the planet. So are we screwed? Aka are we bound to experience serious climate related events no matter what we do? Any reduction in demand of fossil fuels will lower their prices, making fossil fuels extremely attractive to poorer nations. So I worry that no matter what cuts are made, around 40-50% of the world will not pursue any serious emissions reductions at all.  

And if serious warming will occur, wouldn’t it be better to spend our money preparing for those climate events by shoring up our infrastructure rather than tackling a problem that’s inevitable? Or, perhaps we should be investing in new technology that produces energy at rates cheaper than fossil fuels at a much greater pace? If we could get fusion to work, perhaps we wouldn’t have a need for nearly as many fossil fuels. Thoughts?

>Meteorological drought is simply a lack of normal precipitation, whereas a flash drought is marked by an especially rapid onset or strengthening of drought *conditions* (e.g., agricultural or hydrological drought, related to deficits in soil moisture or water storage). Meteorological drought can occur without unusually warm temperatures, but drought *impacts* are intensifying as a result of human-produced warming that’s increased the prevalence of “hot droughts.”

The article explains how the current drought conditions in the U.S. may be the beginning of a prolonged drought, as occurred in the early 1950s.

>Across more than 1,500 months that populate the NOAA database going back to 1895, there’s only one that has a clear edge on October 2024 for national-scale dryness: October 1952.

>As of October 21, this month has notched about 0.57 inches of precipitation when summed across the contiguous United States, according to climatologist Brian Brettscheider (see embedded post below). Typically, each calendar month produces between two and three inches.....But the extreme outlier was [October 1952](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/national/time-series/110/pcp/1/10/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000), which saw only about half of that amount – a mere 0.54 inch, according to NOAA (0.52 inch in the ERA5 reanalysis data used by Brettschneider).

The article notes that October 1952 drought conditions were a prelude to the great U.S. drought of the 1950s, which ""across some parts of the Southern Plains ... actually outdid the 1930s Dust Bowl in terms of both precipitation deficits and intense heat, forcing [more than 100,000 farms and ranches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_Texas_drought) to close in Texas alone and pushing many thousands of people off the land.""

Of course the 1950s did not suffer from the impacts of climate change.  A worry should be that the current drought conditions may not be temporary and may actually accelerate, most especially if mankind doesn't aggressively reduce fossil fuel emissions.

xe6g6u,Basic Global Warming Argument,"Climate sometimes comes up in the physics and astronomy courses I teach, so I gathered a number of resources/arguments on the scientific consensus in one place and wrote it up so I'd have easier access to them.

\- CO2 abundance is rising

\- we're causing it (isotopic C13/C12 ratios, as well as matching the fossil-fuel emissions)

\- CO2 is a greenhouse gas

\- the Earth is warming by just that amount expected

ccuo58,"Meeting with Congressman, are there any qualified persons willing to peer review an article I'm presenting on 100% clean energy?","I'm a college student from Washington State and after meeting with a conservative leader to discuss climate change reform, I got the excuse that 100% clean energy, despite there being a bill being passed for it, is a pipe dream in my state because we don't have sufficient battery capacity in any modern technology to support the power grid. I suspected that this was a well crafted deflection, a ploy allowing them to continue opposing climate change reform while pretending to support it, so I did a little research.

I found this article *Response to ‘Burden of proof: A comprehensive review of the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems’*. It's a great article that refutes many of the arguments perpetrated by those who wish to prolong the use of fossil fuels.

9uew8c,BBC posted a list of ten simple changes anyone can do to reduce carbon footprint,"The time to bicker about what is the best way to fight climate change is long gone. EVERYONE needs to be doing EVERYTHING they can to flight climate change.

1. Limit use of fossil fuels.
2. Hold industries accountable by exercising right as a citizen and a consumer.
3. Take public transport as much as possible.
4. Opt for renewable energy wherever possible.
5. Go Vegan or Vegetarian or at the very least reduce meat intake.
6. Reduce taking flights.
7. Buy local.
8. Less children
9. Spread your message
10. Use carbon footprint calculator.

And for the love of God, stop bickering and finding faults with each other. Support anyone and everyone who takes even the tiniest of steps to fight climate change. I am specifically referring to Republics and Democrats who are both passionate about Climate Change. I am also referring to Vegans who have problems with climate change warriors and also climate change warriors who hate Vegans. You are both in the same team. Stop hating each other.

1anrd35,5 factors to explain the record heat in 2023 — Long-term rise in greenhouse gases is primary driver — Return of El Niño — Long-term ocean warming and hotter-than-normal sea surface temperatures — Decrease in atmospheric aerosols — Tonga volcanic eruption did not substantially add to the record heat,"NASA Earth Observatory: https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152313/five-factors-to-explain-the-record-heat-in-2023   
             
>NASA announced that 2023 was the [hottest year on record](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-analysis-confirms-2023-as-warmest-year-on-record/ ""https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-analysis-confirms-2023-as-warmest-year-on-record/""), according to an analysis of annual global average temperatures by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Scientists who maintain the temperature record, which begins in 1880, calculate a [global temperature anomaly](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/#q101 ""https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/#q101"") each year to determine how much temperatures have changed compared to temperatures from 1951–1980.     
          
>But what caused 2023, especially the second half of it, to be so hot? ...  
            
>The long-term rise in greenhouse gases is the primary driver.  
         
>>For more than 100 years, humans have been burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil to power everything from lightbulbs and cars to factories and cities. These actions, along with changes in land use, have led to a rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. [Greenhouse gases](https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/"") act like a blanket trapping heat around the planet. The more of them you add, the thicker that blanket becomes, further heating Earth.  
        
>>In May 2023, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere peaked at [424 parts per million](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/"") at NOAA’s Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. The annual peak has been steadily rising since measurements began in 1958. (Other global carbon measurement projects showed similarly high numbers.) Extending the record back even further with ice cores, carbon dioxide concentrations are the highest they have been in at least [800,000 years](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/"").    
            
>The return of El Niño added to the heat.  
           
>>On top of the long-term global warming trend are natural variations in the climate. One of the largest sources of such year-to-year variability is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which occurs in the tropical Pacific.  
        
>>From 2020–2022, the Pacific saw three years of [La Niña conditions](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150691/la-nina-times-three ""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150691/la-nina-times-three""). Then [El Niño returned](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151481/el-nino-returns ""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151481/el-nino-returns"") beginning in May 2023. This El Niño has not yet been as strong as those in 2015–2016 or 1997–1998, both of which caused large global average temperature spikes. However, when you add this ocean warming to the long-term warming trend from greenhouse gases, the start of El Niño helped temperatures jump enough to create a new record for heat.  
       
>>“For the most part, it’s us and El Niño,” said Josh Willis, a climate scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “At the end of the day, humans are heating the planet, and El Niño is dancing on our heads.”
            
>Globally, long-term ocean warming and hotter-than-normal sea surface temperatures played a part.  
          
>>Looking more broadly, the tropical Pacific wasn’t the only part of the ocean that was hotter than normal this year. The global sea surface temperature [set new records in 2023](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151743/the-ocean-has-a-fever ""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151743/the-ocean-has-a-fever""), with the North Atlantic and other parts of the ocean experiencing several marine heat waves.  
        
>>“Just like global temperatures, ocean temperatures are on the rise,” said Willis. “They have been rising for the last century or more, and they are not slowing down. If anything, they are speeding up.”  
     
>>What’s behind the rise in ocean temperatures? Greenhouse gases warming the planet. [Around 90 percent](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-warming/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-warming/"") of the heat trapped by rising greenhouse gases is absorbed by the ocean. That means that as greenhouse gases continue to increase, so will ocean temperatures, which raises temperatures across the globe.  
          
>Aerosols are decreasing, so they are no longer slowing the rise in temperatures.  
             
>>Another global trend that scientists are monitoring is a change in aerosols in the atmosphere. [Aerosols](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Aerosols ""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Aerosols"") are small particles in the air—such as smoke, dust, volcanic gases, sea spray, air pollution or soot—that can [impact the climate](https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3271/aerosols-small-particles-with-big-climate-effects/ ""https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3271/aerosols-small-particles-with-big-climate-effects/""). Airborne particles can either reflect sunlight, causing a slight cooling of the air, or absorb sunlight, causing a slight warming of it.  
         
>>As governments have passed regulations to reduce air pollution and improve air quality, the abundance of aerosols has been decreasing in most areas. Many of these human-produced particles are the type that cool the climate slightly, so with less of them in the air, the result is a slight warming effect. But this contribution is quite small in comparison to the much greater warming from rising greenhouse gases.   
         
>Scientists found that the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai volcanic eruption did not substantially add to the record heat.  
         
>>In January 2022, the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai undersea volcano blasted an unprecedented amount of water vapor and fine particles, or aerosols, into the stratosphere. Water vapor, a greenhouse gas, can produce a warming effect on the atmosphere, so scientists investigated the impact of the eruption on the global temperature. [Sulfate aerosols from eruptions](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/VHP/volcanoes-can-affect-climate#:~:text=Injected%20ash%20falls%20rapidly%20from,potential%20to%20promote%20global%20warming ""https://www.usgs.gov/programs/VHP/volcanoes-can-affect-climate#:~:text=Injected%20ash%20falls%20rapidly%20from,potential%20to%20promote%20global%20warming""), on the other hand, have sometimes led to some global cooling events.  
        
>>A [recent study](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104634 ""https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104634"") found that the volcanic sulfate aerosols reflected some sunlight away from Earth’s surface, leading to a slight cooling of less than 0.1 degrees in the southern hemisphere following the eruption. Essentially, the warming that occurred from the increase in water vapor in the stratosphere was offset by the cooling caused by volcanic sulfate aerosols leading to a slight cooling lower in the atmosphere. This means the eruption likely did not add to the record heat in 2023.",1707601760.0,55,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1anrd35/5_factors_to_explain_the_record_heat_in_2023/,fossil fuels,Positive
18rimou,Why is population decline missing from the discussion?,"\[**UPDATE**: Just want to say a hearty ***thank you*** to all of the people who have commented, raised questions and engaged with my post. I love to hear the smart dialogue, interesting questions and great counterpoints.\]  


*(First and foremost: I am not a climate science denier.  I do think climate change and CO2 emissions are a real problem and humanity needs to face these challenges with changes to industry, supply chains and energy production - I am simply arguing that we are failing to account for global population changes)*

I'm very curious why there seems (to me) to be a disconnect between what people *think* about world population and the latest data we have on population and growth.  There seems to be a sense that population is *""growing out of control""* or that there is *""overpopulation, unchecked""* but the data (some sources below) show global population flattening and possibly decreasing in the next 50-100 years.  Also, China--which is always cited as a top emitter of greenhouse gasses--is about to experience a drastic population decline.

* With 600 Million fewer Chinese persons, and a slowing Chinese economy, wouldn't it be likely that supply chains will shift back to more local solutions. (Already, political rhetoric in the EU and North America seems to be switching to 'make it here, not there.')
* India is expected to lose about 500 Million people as well.
* Populations and birth rates in OECD nations are declining across the board for the most part.  Are these not top-emitting nations?
* Populations will be bolstered by growth in developing nations such as those in sub-Saharan Africa and South America, but this might actually result in less CO2 emissions as they switch from very inefficient fuel sources like wood, wood gas and in some cases animal dung to fossil fuels and coal (which, as bad as they are, emit less CO2 per BTU)

Again, none of this means we should stop caring about climate change, but it does seem strange that the above data never seems to make it into public consciousness.  Might we be preparing for the wrong future?

Looking for advice...","TLDR: reading new UN report has me seriously considering quitting my comfortable corporate job in NYC and moving home to California to pursue working to mitigate climate change full-time in business context.  Am I crazy?  Looking for advice!
---

I (26M) grew up in California and have been on the East Coast (DC and now NYC) for about 10 years.  I've been plodding along in my career in B2B tech and currently have a well paying corporate job in NYC.  I majored in a liberal arts-y meets international relations degree with a focus on environment/energy type stuff but ultimately ended up pursuing a more startup/tech scene career.

I've always been very aware of climate change, etc. and the challenges it poses as well as thinking sometimes about how I'd like to refocus my career on this at some point when it makes sense.  However, after reading parts of the UN Climate Report and related coverage (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html), I'm seriously considering quitting my job and moving back to the SF Bay Area in California (to be closer to family and also b/c it seems there is a lot happening there in terms of what I'm interested in) to pursue a career doing SOMETHING to help steer the Earth towards a less sucky future.  I know the cost of living there is quite high.

I'm convinced that we cannot wait for fickle politicians to address this - it must be business solutions to climate change while the general gradually public shifts its tastes/focus by taking these threats seriously (ex: renewable energy becoming more competitive w fossil fuels, meatless 'meat' alternatives, some new refrigerant technology, etc.).  Of course voting in politicians who give a crap about climate change is also important and I intend to do this as well and do whatever I can in terms of public/private partnership type stuff.

I've read the Drawdown book that is frequently cited in this sub.  I have a good amount of money saved up to do a job search for at least a year if necessary but will likely be living with family initially so costs will be low.

Is this crazy?  I feel an urgency to DO SOMETHING that I haven't felt before and feel that I can no longer in good conscience continue in my current career/job (data consulting stuff for fortune 500 companies).

Any guidance is appreciated: ideas about jobs, organizations in SF Bay Area or in wider world, ways to get involved that pay decently, career arcs, feeling like you are truly an agent in this wider effort, etc.  What I want to find is an organization that really does something - not just lip service, not just talk.  Results.  Products.  World-changing feats.  Not BS corporate ""we are going green"" marketing that is meaningless.  I'm aiming high.  I don't want to just feel like I'm ""making a difference"".  I want to know that I truly am, even if it's on a small scale as an individual can only do so much.  Tesla is an obvious, probably cliché example of this (though some would argue there is a lot of talk there!).

I recognize that this is something an optimist would do.  I believe one has to be optimistic in this situation though there is plenty of reason to be pessimistic too given humanity's track record on this issue so far.

pkcygh,"What does it mean that ""20 companies are responsible for almost 50% of emissions""","I saw somewhere a statistic of the same shape (something like ""X companies are responsible for 70% of global CO2 emissions,"" where X is some number around 50 that I don't remember). I looked it up and found this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top\_contributors\_to\_greenhouse\_gas\_emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_contributors_to_greenhouse_gas_emissions).

My question then: what does it mean that Aramco is ""responsible"" for 4.5% of annual emissions? Is it that through its operation it emits so much CO2, or that through the lifespan of its products (fossil fuels) even when it's not at Aramco so much is emitted?

I am asking because this statistic is used to support arguments that individual action will never be enough and that we need to focus on these few corporations. If it's the former (while operating day-to-day, Aramco released so much emissions as to cause 4.5% of global emissions) that argument makes sense to me, but if it's the latter (Aramco sells really polluting products that pollute when people use them) then if people stopped buying that product then the pollution would stop. Obviously there would need to be government action in terms of forcing electric generation and cars to stop using coal and oil, but it's not the companies themselves that are polluting but rather consumers using their products.",1631115516.0,53,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/pkcygh/what_does_it_mean_that_20_companies_are/,fossil fuels,Negative

That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 °C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 °C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal.

9wen2g,"If climate change scientists were right, these things should be happening now.","Ice core records are solid evidence of historical CO2 levels and as a result we know that current CO2 levels are higher than have been in all of human history. 

Half of all cumulative human emissions have occurred during the last ~ 30 years. GHG levels are similar to the cooktop setting on your kitchen range. They determine how hot the pot of water on the stove will ultimately get. The time it takes to reach that equilibrium temperature depends on the volume of water and the composition of the container. 

The ocean is effectively a giant pot of water that takes something like 3-4 decades to incorporate 60% of the heat associated with the new temperature setting. 

If scientists predictions about climate change are accurate, then we would have noticed some changes in the last 30 years. Let's review. 

1) The atmosphere would be warmer

The 20 warmest years on record are the last 20 since 1998.

2) The oceans would be warmer

Oceans are warmer than ever

3) Oceans would be more acidic due to CO2 absorption

Oceans are 30% more acidic. oH has declined from 8.2 to 8.1

4) Ice sheets would be be melting / calving faster

They are

5) Melting ice from Greenland would slow the AMOC

The AMOC has slowed 15% in 50 years

6) Storm intensity would increase

15 storms with sustained winds over 150mph in last 3 years. This is unprecedented. Highest wind speed storm all-time in 2015. 

7) Extreme rain events would increase as a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor (Clausius Clapeyron)

These are happening too

8) The Jet stream should be weakening as the temperature differential between the Arctic and mid-latitudes lessens

The jet stream is getting weaker and more prone to getting stuck in place for longer periods of time.

1bjv3lq,Rising Ocean Temperature,"The United Nations weather agency has issued a ""red alert"" on climate change after record heat in 2023. It is expected this year, 2024, will be worse than last year.

Ocean temperatures are currently on an alarming rise, reaching  unprecedented levels in 2024. This increase in temperature has serious  consequences for the ocean's ecosystems and human populations.  Rising ocean temperatures can lead to mass coral bleaching, a deadly  phenomenon that decimates coral reefs, crucial to marine biodiversity.  Corals are the foundation of many ecological systems, supporting countless  other organisms.

[Each line is the ocean temperature during a given year \(1982 through 2022\). The mean ocean temperature is the dotted black line. The colorful lines are the ocean temperatures in the last few years, showing them to be the hottest on record. The dark black line at the top is what it was in 2023. Already in 2024 it is higher than 2023.](https://preview.redd.it/gs6vezt3flpc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=17673adb8e97de50040510a941f7444c8bdccdf2)

[As the atmosphere heats up, the oceans heat up, potentially causing a rise in sea level and a disruption of vital ocean currents that regulate weather around the world.](https://preview.redd.it/8zg7cn88elpc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=402bd7ffae2a9abc1549537c46f692b8b26f7d11)

The loss of coral reefs would have devastating  consequences for marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of millions who  depend on them.  Furthermore, rising ocean temperatures affect marine species' ability to  adapt. Warmer waters can cause changes in distribution patterns, making it  challenging for organisms to find suitable habitats or locate food sources. This could result in mass extinctions and the loss of crucial linkages in  ecological chains.  Rising ocean temperatures also pose risks to human communities.

Rising sea  levels can threaten coastal areas, causing erosion, flooding, and  destruction of infrastructure. Additionally, warmer waters may lead to more frequent and intense marine heatwaves, harming fish stocks and disrupting  marine ecological balances.

16ofg3p,Making the world around us better makes our lives better - not worse.,"It is a widespread misconception that changing our lifestyles to be more ecologically healthy would result in suffering of some sort.  It would result in change - not suffering.

If the air quality increases in your immediate surrounding your life will improve.  If the quality of your food increases, your quality of life will improve.  If there is more natural biodiversity in the world around you, you will generally be happier, since generally people have too little biodiversity in their environment.

Society doesn't necessarily need to ""grind to a halt"" to stop ecologic catastrophe.  The ecological collapse is complex and isn't going to be completely 100% solved by a few steps, but lets look at some examples.  Converting to solar and wind is actually going to improve your life because it's at minimum a 14% return on investment (if you do it yourself), and it increases air quality, and makes you more independent.  Taxing pollution like gas and oil and non-recyclable packaging and using those taxes to implement solutions for things like reforestation, wildlife refuge preservation, trash cleanup, community gardens, education, and recycling centers isn't going to grind society to a halt - it's going to increase the quality of life for people.

From 2018 to 2022, researchers from Argonne National Lab visited the solar farms around 20 times to monitor the health of the plants and study the insects they attracted.

By the end of the study, the scientists had spotted almost 11,000 different insects, and they discovered that the number of native bees at the solar farms surged, growing 20-fold in just five years.

They even found monarch butterflies and their caterpillar progenitors in the fields. With pollinators facing a dramatic decline, habitats like this are essential.

Three out of every four plants in North America, including crops, depend on pollinators.

Luckily, the bounty of bugs these habitats attract spills over into surrounding fields.

In fact, more bees visit farms near the flower-skirted solar panels than visit those further afield.

n0jwxh,Climate change impacts in agriculture in The Netherlands,"So I’m currently doing my thesis on the impacts of climatic trends in agriculture in the Netherlands, especially (agricultural) droughts. Though it would be nice to share some information on this subject to help climate impact feel more tangible.

Since 2018 the Netherlands has experienced above climatic average drought conditions during the summer months. These droughts have increasingly challenged agricultural crop production. In 2018, maize yields on sandy soils saw a reduction in the 70% range as it proved to be very poorly resistant to extreme drought. While reductions in potato crops ranged up to 20% to 25% for unirrigated plots. In total, the damages as a result of the 2018 drought was estimated at between 375 million to 1.9 billion euros.

First of all to clear the air, let me say that yes, due to the increased CO2 fertilization effect we can expect plants to be more water efficient during the photosynthesis process. However, this is a mechanism often taken out of context by climate pseudo-sceptics. The mechanism holds well for processes at the leaf level which are often studied using controlled laboratory experiments, but one should caution when upscaling this relation from the leaf level to ecosystem level such as a crop architecture where the multiple confounding effects of the real world come into play.

You see, it’s really nice that plants start to become more water efficient under higher CO2 concentrations, but that holds no value anymore once the soil is close to or completely rid of any soil water the plant can access at all. At that point, which we call the wilting point, the photosynthesis process can no longer take place, as the plant no longer has access to water which, by splitting into O2 and the H+ proton under sunlight, provides the critically needed energy for the photosynthetic process. Also, plants cool down by transpiring water from their leaves, just as we humans do as we sweat. Once water becomes limited, plants can no longer shed their heat and start to get sunburned or photosynthesis is reduced due to the enzymes disliking to function at such temperatures. What also should be noted is that an increase in water use efficiency only covers transpiration from the plant leaves, and thus does not include the expected increase in evaporation of water directly from the soil projected to come with climate change which in turn influences the total available soil moisture a plant can use to transpire.

We think that we are increasingly starting to see that here in the Netherlands an increase in water use efficiency (WUE) only delays the occurrence of droughts in agriculture. In the end, the higher efficiency does not outweigh the increases in evapotranspiration and temperature in the long run. It’s a bit like driving the same distance with a more fuel-efficient car as you did with your older car, but with not enough gas to make it to your destination. Crops can benefit from from the increased WUE for a period of time in the growing season, but in the end it loses the battle anyway when there's very little or no water available at all anymore in the high summer months, which are often critical periods for plants in which they normally put energy in developing the botanical parts we humans are interested in (e.g. the potatoes tubers / maize cobs). On top of that, potatoes start to grow very poorly at temperatures above 25 degrees celcius, temperatures which are easily being surpassed by well over 10 degrees celcius in recent years, up to a record 40.9 degrees celcius in the summer of 2019 and more and more days on which get close to such temperatures.

Recently I’ve went through some papers which indicated that due to higher temperatures in the spring, as we’ve seen in the past few years, summer droughts in agriculture are exacerbated. This is due to natural vegetation starting to grow earlier and thus transpiring soil water earlier in the year. Under a lack of precipitation, this reduces the water crops can take up from the soil.

Despite our drought problems, precipitation has actually increased by 26% in the Netherlands in the past 100 years. The problem is that these increases are primarily featured during the winter months. Precipitation events in the summer have become concentrated in more intense showers with more water falling from the sky per unit of time. These intense precipitation events tighten the ground very quickly causing overland flow of water so that precipitation is quickly discharged into streams which discharge the water away from the farming systems quickly, and the water does not infiltrate into the soil instead. This immediately lays bare an important issue in the design of the farming landscape in the Netherlands; we have designed our agricultural landscape to be able to be discharged easily in case of excessive amounts of water flooding our lands which we are known for to have been battling for hundreds of years. Now these systems designed to easily transport water away, which we often still need during the winter, cause water to be transported away too quickly in the summer months when it’s needed on the fields. So, by fixing one problem mostly occurring during winter, we exacerbate another one during the summer.

Another important boundary conditions from which the water in the soil develops is the groundwater table. I’ve looked up the data on the groundwater monitoring wells in the area I’m from (which is dominated by sandy soils) and since 2015 the average groundwater table has decreased by up to 60 cm on average. Let’s say from about 80 cm for a plot I’m studying, to about 140 cm, and the trend is continuing downward up to this date. Sure the groundwater gets filled up in the winter to about the same amount every year, but the replenishment has increasingly been outweighed by the increased evapotranspiration in the summer.

Now I’ve talked to farmers in the area which are suffering from these droughts (When I was young I’ve always had side jobs in agriculture myself). They have to spend much more time, energy and money to maintain their crops, and still these efforts do not guarantee an acceptable crop yield. Of course, this is impacting their finances, and there’s been increasing discussion on the feasibility of current agricultural practices in the Netherlands.

Note that this post focusses on droughts in relation to agriculture. For natural ecosystems, however, the droughts have had similar negative impacts. Streams run dry from which fish have to be rescued, animals are suffering from heat stress, there’s been an increase in forest fires and peat gets oxidized causing problematic land subsidence. This is occurring in already problematic times for the natural environment suffering from excessive nitrogen usage by farmers and subsequent biodiversity loss.

We are seeing some other severely negative impacts of climate change in The Netherlands. Theses include land subsidence, salt water intrusion, adverse psychological affects of heat and damage to infrastructure, but I would like to come back to these topics later in different posts.",1619630506.0,44,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/n0jwxh/climate_change_impacts_in_agriculture_in_the/,biodiversity,Positive

You can’t come back from those things.”","https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/03/12/how-climate-change-drives-the-spread-of-invasive-plants/

Some alien species—that is, plants or animals that live outside their natural range—are invasive and can harm ecosystems and the areas they invade with serious impacts on the global food supply, medicines, water quality, biodiversity, and livelihoods. 
         
>Rising temperatures, increased CO2, and extreme weather that alters landscapes favor the spread of invasive species, which also exacerbate climate impacts by making habitats, agriculture and cities less resilient. For example, when invasive plants overrun native plants and establish a monoculture, the area may be more susceptible to wildfires or pests. This phenomenon may intensify the effects of climate change on humans and our environment.     
        
>What are invasive plants?  
    
>Not all alien or non-native plant species are invasive. Invasive plants are defined as those that adapt easily to new environments, reproduce quickly, and damage the native species, ecosystems, property or economy of their new terrain. Many food crops, such as wheat, rice, tomatoes, and garden plants are non-native and are not considered invasive.  
        
>A recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) [report](https://www.ipbes.net/IASmediarelease ""https://www.ipbes.net/IASmediarelease"") estimated that 6% of all alien plants are invasive. In 2019, invasive alien species, both plants and animals, cost the world more than $423 billion a year.  
          
>Why should we worry about invasive plants?  
     
>In the next 50 years, one million species are in danger of extinction globally. Invasive species are a major cause of biodiversity loss. They degrade wildlife habitats and water quality, disrupt ecosystems and alter food webs. In turn, the loss of biodiversity facilitates invasion by non-native species. “Diversity on its face has some advantages like resistance to change or resilience in the face of change,” said Palmer.  
           
>Because they may outcompete native plants, invasive plants can turn diverse ecosystems into monocultures, which are susceptible to collapse because they have a set of traits suited to a particular set of conditions. “If the conditions change, then you could suddenly lose them all,” said Palmer. “For example, if you’re a farmer that only grows one type of crop and a pathogen comes and wipes out your crop, you’re out of luck. But if you grow 10 crops and a pathogen wipes out one, you’ve got the other nine to buffer some of that risk.”  
        
>Islands are particularly vulnerable to invasive plants because the native species have evolved in isolation to survive in their unique environment. The IPBES [report](https://www.ipbes.net/IASmediarelease ""https://www.ipbes.net/IASmediarelease"") found that invasive plants now outnumber native plants on more than 25% of all islands.

tbnwum,"What does the IPCC's Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation & Vulnerability WG2 report say?","A couple weeks ago the IPCC released a report called [Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation & Vulnerability](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-ii/) . It's the second of three assessments looking into the human and environmental costs of climate change. This installment looks at the causes, impacts and potential solutions and builds on the first report released in August 2021, [Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/).

So what exactly does this new report say? Well, a lot! It goes into more detail about what will happen as we move from the. current 1.1 degree celsius of average global surface temperature warming towards 1.5 degrees.

In particular it builds on the science to explore and provide further guidance on what we can all expect - along with all other living things on the planet - the future to hold due to anthropogenic (aka caused by human activity) climate change.

The report shows that:

\- extreme weather events connected to climate change - like floods and heatwaves - are impacting people and other species more than previously thought, and at the high end of what the model scenarios predict

\- between 2010 to 2020,15 times more people died from floods, droughts and storms in more vulnerable locations than in other parts of the world

\- it says that overshooting a 1.5 degree rise means ""there's an increasing risk of hitting tipping points"" that are irreversible

\- the impact of warming on nature is already dramatic

\- trees dying from drought, coral bleaching, sea level rise, both accelerating loss and migration of species (about half of species are already moving to higher ground or towards the poles. Nearly 15% are considered very high risk of extinction at 1.5 degrees of warming, rising to 29% with a 3 degrees temperature increase)

\- all scenarios explored suggest a billion more people will be at risk from coastal climate events in the coming decades

\- about 40% of the human population are ""highly vulnerable"" to the impacts of climate change for various reasons, including how habitable where they live will be to food security

\- if temperatures increase beyond 1.5 degrees, towards 1.8, up to half the human population could be exposed to life threatening heat and humidity events 

\- the report discusses how technology alone is not a silver bullet and that carbon removal may also trigger release in a ""rebound effect"" from existing carbon sinks

\- it calls for 30-50% of the planet to be conserved and highlights how that willl have a significant impact limiting the more extreme outcomes

\- it highlights that climate justice, investing in education, health systems and social justice will help people to adapt and cope with the impacts in the future

**Decade of Action**

Professor Debra Roberts, co-chair of the IPCC, says ""...clearly indicates that places where people live and work may cease to exist and species we've grown up with...may disappear. So this is a key moment, this is the decade of action, if we are going to turn things around.""

There is still time. A lead author of the report, Dr Helen Adams, says that ""the future depends on us, not the climate."" While some of the changes we're already seeing are irreversible, what we do now and how fast we do it, will make a difference. We are able to slow, and sometimes reverse the impacts, as well as reduce the severity of climate change both for humans and all other living things on the planet.

This next decade is the one that will have the most impact in mitigating the worst effects of the climate change that it already happening. It is also our opportunity to prepare to adapt to a hotter climate with more frequent weather events and extremes.

The report stresses the importance of Climate Resilient Development as an important route to making progress. It's ""enabled when governments, civil society and the private sector make inclusive development choices that prioritise risk reduction, equity and justice, and when decision-making processes, finance and actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors and timeframes.""

""Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilient development... maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale depends on effective and equitable conservation of approximately 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean areas, including currently near-natural ecosystems.""

We need to work together and with a new level of consideration and co-ordination to make this our new reality. It's all to play for and the next decade is crucial.

ar64um,How to deal with Climate Anxiety,"Having lurked on this thread, and experienced many of the issues that other members have faced i.e. a sense of doom and gloom and helplessness ib this situation, I thought I would offer some advice on how to mentally deal with this scenario.

In an age where continual growth is the aim, where 'smashing our goals', and competing against everyone is all that matters, we've lost a sense of perspective. Life has become ubfeasible.

The truth is, you alone cannot solve the world's problems. Most of us can't even solve the problems of people closest to us, let alone the lives of strangers thousands of miles away. So, let's focus on what we can control. This is where stoic philosophy comes into play.

The stoics believed that there are only two things you can control; everything else is secondary. They are:

1. Your thoughts
2. Your actions

You cannot control how hot the world is going to get. You cannot control the decline of biodiversity. You cannot stop fossil fuels burning. 

What you CAN control, is your behaviour which can ultimately affect the world in a positive way.

Your job, every single day, is to simply focus on being the best citizen you can be. Being environmentally aware. Being positive. Whether you influence those around you or not, is out of your control. So don't worry about it. 

Remember this, and you will feel better about yourself, will worry less about how others will perceive you, and without realising, your actions will have impact.",1550298099.0,39,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ar64um/how_to_deal_with_climate_anxiety/,biodiversity,Positive

1gwn1vo,Thermosyphon to remove heat from the ocean to desalination water,"Refined Thermosyphon System: Design and Operational Summary

The thermosyphon system is a cutting-edge, scalable solution designed to extract excess heat from ocean water, generate freshwater, and contribute to climate change mitigation. Through innovative integration of renewable energy, sustainable materials, and advanced technologies, the system provides a multifaceted approach to address critical global challenges, including water scarcity, ocean warming, and environmental protection.
Core Components and Functions

    Central Thermosyphon Cylinder

        Heat Extraction:
        The vertical thermosyphon leverages the temperature gradient between warm surface water and cooler deep water. A working fluid (CO₂ or ammonia) absorbs heat from the ocean surface, causing the fluid to evaporate and rise through the system.

        Heat Rejection:
        The heated refrigerant flows to a heat rejection chamber, where it condenses within an insulated pool, transferring the extracted heat to the desalination process. The cooled fluid returns to repeat the cycle.

    Insulated Pool with Integrated Desalination

        Evaporation:
        The insulated pool captures the rejected heat, creating a warm environment that maximizes evaporation. The system is insulated to reduce energy loss.

        Condensation:
        A transparent cover traps evaporated water vapor, which is directed toward inclined condensation panels. These panels cool the vapor, causing it to condense into fresh water.

        Freshwater Collection:
        Condensed freshwater is funneled into gravity-driven drip channels leading to storage tanks. A separate outlet for brine ensures salinity is managed effectively.

    Concentric Structural Design for Stability and Efficiency

        Stability and Efficiency:
        The central thermosyphon is supported by radial horizontal arms, ensuring stability. Solar panels and flotation devices are arranged concentrically to optimize space for both energy collection and heat rejection.

        Energy Optimization:
        Solar panels provide auxiliary power, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing reliance on external energy sources. They also serve as partial shading for the desalination pool, reducing evaporation losses.

    Modular, Scalable, and Autonomous Operation

        Modular Pods:
        The system is designed with modular components, allowing for easy scalability to meet the needs of different regions. Pods can be connected or disconnected as required, offering flexibility for varying community sizes and environmental conditions.

        Autonomous Maintenance:
        Autonomous robots or drones can be deployed for cleaning, inspection, and maintenance, reducing human intervention and extending the system's lifespan.

    Advanced Environmental Protection

        Double-Wall Heat Exchanger:
        The heat exchanger is designed with a double-wall construction, allowing any refrigerant leaks to safely vent to the atmosphere, preventing contamination of the water and the formation of carbonic acid.

        Eco-Friendly Coatings:
        Non-toxic, anti-fouling coatings are applied to all exposed surfaces to prevent biofouling and corrosion. These coatings are made from sustainable, bio-based materials that minimize environmental impact.

        Brine Management:
        Brine discharge is managed using advanced filtration or concentration techniques, reducing the environmental impact. In some cases, brine can be converted into valuable byproducts like salt or magnesium for industrial uses.

Energy Efficiency and Carbon Capture

    Energy Storage and Hybrid Power Systems

        Battery Storage:
        Solar power is stored in batteries, ensuring continuous system operation during low sunlight or at night. This energy storage reduces the system's reliance on external power sources.

        Hybrid Power:
        Integration with wave energy converters or tidal turbines offers a consistent power supply, particularly in remote coastal areas, further increasing system efficiency.

    Carbon Capture and Sequestration
        Carbon Capture Units:
        The system can be equipped with carbon capture technologies that extract CO₂ from the atmosphere or seawater, sequestering it in deep oceanic storage or in mineralized forms, contributing to climate change mitigation.

    Phase Change Materials (PCMs):
        Thermal Energy Storage:
        The incorporation of PCMs within the system can store excess heat for later use, balancing fluctuations in energy demand and improving overall thermal efficiency.

Symbiosis with Marine Ecosystems

    Artificial Reefs and Aquaculture Platforms

        Marine Habitat Creation:
        The flotation devices and structural components can function as artificial reefs, providing habitat for marine organisms. This promotes biodiversity and supports marine ecosystems.

        Aquaculture Integration:
        The system can be integrated with sustainable aquaculture practices, such as fish farming or seaweed cultivation, providing additional food sources while also helping maintain water quality.

    Seaweed Farming for Carbon Sequestration
        Seaweed farms could be cultivated alongside the thermosyphon units, contributing to carbon sequestration while also supporting marine biodiversity and providing sustainable bio-products.

    Eco-Friendly Designs for Marine Life
        The system employs acoustic dampeners and low-profile designs to reduce noise pollution and physical disturbance to marine species, ensuring the system operates harmoniously within its environment.

Outreach and Community Engagement

    Public Awareness and Education
        An interactive dashboard can track system performance and environmental impact, offering transparency and educational opportunities for local communities, NGOs, and the general public.

    Eco-Tourism Integration
        The system can incorporate eco-tourism elements, such as observation platforms or guided tours, generating additional revenue to support ongoing operations and increasing awareness of sustainable ocean technologies.

    Collaborations with Governments and NGOs
        Partnerships with environmental organizations, local governments, and academic institutions can help further research, provide funding, and support system adoption in coastal regions.

Conclusion: A Scalable and Sustainable Solution

The refined thermosyphon system offers a self-sustaining, environmentally friendly solution for addressing global challenges such as water scarcity, ocean warming, and climate change. By integrating renewable energy, eco-friendly materials, modular design, and innovative cooling technologies, the system can be scaled to meet the specific needs of various regions while fostering symbiotic relationships with marine ecosystems. It represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable freshwater production, climate adaptation, and ocean conservation, with the potential for broad adoption by coastal communities, governments, and environmental organizations.

179k1l6,Why is the climate change cost in terms of GDP relatively low in the current white house and IPCC reports,"The white house has a report from this year, as well as last year and there's an IPCC report  on the actual cost of climate chagne. They all line up more or less. Basically even if we end up with 3 degrees the cost of climate change by 2100 will be still less than 1% of GDP annually if i understand correctly. Transitioning with current tech will cost at minimum 5% annually from what i understand. Now that is US based, while the IPCC is a global estimate. Maybe either way the cost would need to be subsidized by the developed world.

There's several things the IPCC has anything more than medium confidence on. Ecological droughts (not any other type of drought), extreme heat, mean air temperature, cold spells, permafrost, lake river and sea ice, mean ocean temperature, ocean salinity, dissolved oxygen, atmospheric CO2 at surface

Ecological droughts can be solved with desalination, we'd realistcally need to help other countries finance it tough. Desalination is used at mass scale already, ie, gulf states, israel, california

We don't have actual food shortages except from a distribution point of view and our yields are going up at a mind boggling rate from continued tech advances in agri tech.

I do not understand the damage of ocean temp, salinity, and dissolved oxygen well, i'd welcome someone chiming in here. Maybe this wouldn't factor well into the GDP cost as seafood is a minority in calories per capita, 7-8 percent roughly. Would we lose a lot of biodiversity in the Oceans?

As far as cold spells and extreme heat events, it is energy that solves this for us. However, once again any other species that does not own Air conditioner is disrupted. How bad is this?

As far as humans, it is energy that keeps people from freezing to death or overheating to death. In the poorest countries they are very price sensitive and the cost of energy can mean life and death for the poorest of us. If we penalize the supply chain of fossil fuels too much we have high energy prices that affect people severely in developing nations, can cause geopolitical instability and could lead to more war as in a tight energy market we have less ability to sanction.

I'd like to test a point a view to be debated on that disrupting civilization by going too fast or in a way that's too penalizing could cost more than 1% and that ""cost"" in both scenarios do incorporate human suffering, what are your thoughts? However, would we still want to make that trade-off for all the reasons that don't get represented well in GDP cost, like loss of biodiversity for example, and what are those costs that are not represented in the GPD cost?

We should obviously do this with urgency. But is there a level where it actually becomes more harmful to us? Also how do we do it? I'm particularly interested how we do it if nuclear is off the table?

zlz6g9,The Impact of Climate Change on Biodiversity and the Struggle for Survival,"**Introduction:**

The decline of biodiversity is a massive problem that is only compounded by climate change. Human activities such as deforestation, overfishing, and the burning of fossil fuels have drastically altered the natural world and continue to put pressure on animal and plant species. As global warming accelerates, the ability of species to adapt to these changes becomes increasingly uncertain. 

All over the world, humans are changing nature. Centuries of forest clearing, land consumption through urbanization and industrial development, overfishing, extraction of raw materials and burning of fossil fuels, the rise of modern society was based on a historically unprecedented exploitation of nature. Almost no area of the world is still untouched by humans; on an estimated three-quarters of the land surface, they are putting pressure on nature ([Venter et al. 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303539404_Editorial_citing_Venter_et_al_2016_article)). And **climate change will further exacerbate problems for animal and plant species.**

For example, the [2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Report](https://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf) (an environmental report of comparable scope to the IPCC's climate reports) drew a grim conclusion: **60 percent** of all ecosystems were already degraded at that time. The extinction rate was **already a hundred to a thousand times higher** than usual in the history of the earth. In Southeast Asia, for example, up to **42 percent of all species could become extinct by 2100 simply due to deforestation and habitat fragmentation**, according to one study ([Brook 2003](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200032746_Vulnerability_Risk_and_Adaptation_A_Conceptual_Framework)).

Global warming by humans is already rapid and will accelerate in the coming decades. The IPCC predicts warming of up to **0.5 °C per decade** by the end of the century, which is up to a **hundred times faster than the warming at the end of the last ice age.** One study found that current global warming is proceeding about **170 times faster** than natural climate changes. ([Gaffney/Steffen 2017](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/publications/publications/2018-06-26-the-anthropocene-equation.html)).

A study of more than 500 species concluded that, given the amount of global warming expected this century, **adaptation should be several thousand times faster** than has been observed in species to date ([Quintero/Wiens 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263062541_Corrigendum_to_Quintero_Wiens_2013)).

Even with an **optimistically estimated warming** of about 2.5 °C by the end of the century, the average global temperature of the Earth's surface would **produce climatic conditions** that last prevailed in the **middle of the Pliocene**, about **three million years ago**. Global warming of 4 °C, on the other hand (which is what it would amount to if greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked), would **catapult** the Earth back **within just one century** to a climate that would lead in the longer term to a largely ice-free Earth's surface, such as last prevailed during the **Eocene**, **about 35 million years ago**. In contrast, the **average survival time** of a species is only **one to three million years,** so it is entirely possible that in the extremely brief moment of a century, from a geological perspective, **conditions** will arise on Earth that **modern species have never faced**.

In the past, animal and plant species usually **adapted** to climatic changes **by shifting their habitats** to more northerly or southerly latitudes (depending on the warming or cooling of the climate) or to higher or lower mountain altitudes. Evolutionary adaptations also occurred: The most adaptable specimens of a species survived and passed on their resilience to future generations. Today, however, these adaptation strategies are of **little or no help** in most cases due to the reasons mentioned above. Current global climate change is simply **too profound and is occurring too rapidly**.

 In conclusion, the decline of biodiversity and the effects of climate change are **a massive problem** that affects the entire world. It is essential that we take action to address these issues and find solutions to protect biodiversity and combat climate change. This can include reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, protecting natural habitats, and promoting sustainable development. By **taking action now**, we can help ensure that future generations can enjoy the benefits of a healthy and diverse planet.

 Here are some bullet points on what each of us can do to combat climate change:

* Reduce our carbon footprint by driving less, using public transportation, carpooling, or biking
* Use energy-efficient appliances and lighting
* Plant trees and support reforestation efforts
* Support renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power
* Reduce our consumption of meat and dairy products
* Support conservation efforts to protect habitats and biodiversity
* Educate ourselves and others about the impacts of climate change and what we can do to combat it
* Vote for political leaders who prioritize addressing climate change and supporting environmentally-friendly policies.",1671044328.0,9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/zlz6g9/the_impact_of_climate_change_on_biodiversity_and/,biodiversity,Positive

114v1lf,1 Key Idea To Understand The Complexity Of Wildfires in a Climate Change Scenario," 

The ongoing wildfires in Chile have left many wondering about their underlying causes.

While multiple factors contribute to the occurrence of wildfires in Chile, it is important to look beyond their individual impact and consider their interactions. Having a science background obliges me to talk about a critical idea to understand how complex systems work:

# 🔀 Interaction between contributing factors is more relevant than individual factors themselves.

These contributing factors include:

* human activity,
* forestry practices,
* public policy,
* insufficient fire prevention funding,
* meteorological conditions such as heat waves,
* climate change

It is crucial to address these factors collectively and understand their interplay to prevent wildfires effectively.

For example, while human activity may be the starting point of a fire, climate change can exacerbate meteorological conditions and make it more challenging to extinguish the fire. Inadequate forestry regulations and insufficient firebreaks in urban areas also contribute to the spread of wildfires. Therefore, to address this issue, it is necessary to evaluate all contributing factors and their interactions thoroughly.

This requires the concerted effort of society, including policymakers and citizens, to push for greater scrutiny and regulation.

# 🎗️ Remember: 

Wildfires not only severely affect air quality and biodiversity but also 

**accelerate climate change.**

In short, acknowledging the complexity of wildfires and taking a comprehensive approach to prevention is crucial for mitigating their impact.

Understanding complex systems requires looking beyond individual factors and recognizing how they interact with each other.",1676661478.0,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/114v1lf/1_key_idea_to_understand_the_complexity_of/,biodiversity,Positive

1gcf7kr,Plastic Pollution: Balancing the Benefits and the Costs of a Global Crisis,"Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time, affecting ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. But the conversation around plastic is often more complex than it seems. While many advocate for drastic reductions in plastic use, others point out the benefits that plastics bring to modern life. So, where do we draw the line, and how do we balance the pros and cons?

The Scale of the Problem

Let’s start with the basics: the sheer volume of plastic pollution is staggering. An estimated 8 million tons of plastic enter our oceans each year, and by 2050, it's projected that there will be more plastic than fish in the sea by weight​. Once plastic is in the ocean, it doesn't go away. It breaks down into microplastics, which are now found everywhere from the deepest ocean trenches to the fish we eat. Studies have shown that nearly 90% of marine species have been negatively affected by plastic, whether through ingestion or entanglement​.

Moreover, plastic waste has profound impacts on human health. Microplastics have been found in human blood, and there is growing concern about the long-term health effects of consuming food and water contaminated with these particles. The chemicals used in plastic production, like BPA, are known endocrine disruptors, and their widespread presence in our environment raises serious public health concerns​.

The Benefits of Plastic

But here’s where the conversation becomes more nuanced. For all the harm it does, plastic also brings significant benefits to modern life. It’s lightweight, durable, and incredibly versatile. Plastic has revolutionized industries like healthcare, where single-use plastics have reduced infection rates in hospitals by providing sterile environments and tools. In the food industry, plastic packaging extends the shelf life of perishable items, reducing food waste and the resources needed to transport goods​.

From car parts to electronics, plastics have allowed us to create safer, more energy-efficient products. For example, lighter cars and planes made with plastic components use less fuel, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So, while plastics are a pollution problem, they are also key in some environmental solutions, which is why many argue for a balanced approach rather than a complete plastic ban.

The Case for Reduction and Alternatives

Despite its benefits, the evidence is clear: we can’t continue producing and disposing of plastic at the current rate. According to the WWF, even if all plastic production were to stop today, microplastic levels in the ocean would more than double by 2050​. So, how do we strike a balance?

One promising avenue is the development of biodegradable alternatives to conventional plastics. Companies are experimenting with materials like bioplastics made from corn or sugarcane, which can break down more easily in the environment. There are also efforts to create closed-loop systems where plastic is continually recycled instead of being discarded after a single use. However, biodegradable plastics and recycling systems are not without their own challenges. For instance, many ""compostable"" plastics require industrial facilities to break down properly, which may not be available in all regions​.

The Role of Policy and Corporate Responsibility

Many experts argue that the most effective solutions will come from large-scale policy changes rather than relying solely on individual action. Governments worldwide have started to take notice, implementing bans on single-use plastics and introducing incentives for companies to reduce plastic production. The European Union's 2019 directive banning single-use plastic items like cutlery and straws is a prime example of how regulation can push industries toward more sustainable practices​.

However, critics argue that policies alone aren't enough. Plastic pollution is a global issue, but many of the countries most affected by it lack the infrastructure to manage waste properly. For example, Southeast Asia is responsible for a significant portion of the plastic entering the ocean, largely due to inadequate waste management systems​. Addressing the root causes of plastic pollution in these regions will require international cooperation and investment in better waste management.

Meanwhile, corporations that profit from plastic production need to take more responsibility. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs are being touted as one solution, where companies are held accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, from production to disposal. Companies like Unilever and Nestlé have already pledged to reduce their plastic usage and invest in recycling, but critics argue that these efforts are often too little, too late​.

The Individual’s Role

While systemic change is crucial, individuals also have a part to play in tackling plastic pollution. Reducing personal plastic consumption by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers is a start, but it’s only a small piece of the puzzle. What’s needed is a cultural shift toward understanding that waste—plastic or otherwise—has long-term consequences.

Recycling, though often touted as the solution, isn’t a cure-all. In fact, only around 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled​. This low percentage highlights the need for better systems and education around recycling, as well as the fact that many types of plastic can’t be recycled at all due to contamination or material complexity.

Where Do We Go from Here?

The truth is, there’s no single answer to the plastic pollution problem. The best path forward likely involves a combination of individual action, corporate responsibility, innovative technologies, and government regulations. We need to rethink not just how we use plastic, but how we produce, manage, and dispose of all materials in our global economy.

What do you think? Is the key to tackling plastic pollution individual responsibility, corporate accountability, or policy change? And are biodegradable alternatives really the solution, or just another stopgap?

ktgug5,What college course should I do to help fight against climate change?,"Hi, I’m in my last year in school and I need to start picking college courses too. I want to be involved in the fight against climate change, but I’m not sure which course would be the best for it. 

I was thinking maybe engineering would be good for coming up with and developing solutions like electric cars and solar panels, hydroelectric dams etc. 

Maybe chemistry would be good for developing a carbon filter or developing batteries more efficiently store energy. 

Or would physics be better so I could learn about nuclear and energy in general.

Or maybe ecology or something like that to help to restore biodiversity that has been lost from human causes

kff3dr,Protecting world’s oceans need of the hour,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for better managing the fading relationship between humans and the natural world that has resulted in accelerating loss of ocean habitat due to [climate change](https://theworldreviews.com/climate-change-protecting-worlds-oceans-need-of-the-hour/). In this regard, the need for developing new and more effective marine protected areas (MPAs) has grown exponentially.

It is important to note that two-thirds of the international waters fall outside jurisdictions of countries across the world. These water bodies provide shelter to millions of marine species and wide ranging natural resources. However, they are facing severe damage due to climate change and human activities.

A 2019 global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services stated that 66 per cent of the world’s oceans are facing increasing challenges due to increasing human activities such as fishing and commercial trading. Earlier this year, scientists reported that almost half of the Great Barrier Reef’s corals have died off since 1995. ***In September, it was reported that two of Antarctica’s largest glaciers were close to collapsing***. Similar incidents are being recorded from various parts of the world as rapidly-developing impacts of an impending climate catastrophe. 

The United Nations plays a crucial role in ocean governance and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has emerged as a key international agreement that grants coastal and island states authority over massive oceans termed as exclusive economic zones (EEZ).

While UNCLOS has been in place to regulate human activities in the high seas, this international legal agreement appears to be failing to protect the marine ecosystems.

Taking note of the deteriorating conditions of the world’s oceans, leaders from 14 countries recently pledged to sustainably manage the oceans under their national jurisdictions by 2025. Led by The Ocean Panel, these countries  have also vowed to designate 30 percent of the seas as marine protected areas in the next 10 years, in line with the United Nations campaign – 30 by 30. 

Currently, MPAs are covering only 7.66 per cent of the water bodies across the world, noting that most of these areas come under the jurisdiction of a country such that they are effective protected. 

***In the absence of a full-fledged UN treaty on marine life, these 14 countries are working on a series of commitments to establish the world’s biggest initiative on ocean sustainability.***

Combined, these 14 countries including Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico among others represent 40 percent of the world’s coastlines, 30 percent of the offshore exclusive economic zones (EEZs), 20 percent of world’s shipping fleet, and 20 percent of the world’s fisheries. Meanwhile, these nations have invited other world governments as well to join the initiative to protect the ocean biodiversity.

Research have indicated that if oceans were managed sustainably, there could be six times more food fished from these waters. It could also provide favourable social, economic, health and environmental benefits, in addition to creating 12 million new jobs. 

**A new ocean treaty**

In December 2017, the UN General Assembly decided to convene negotiations towards designing a new comprehensive international treaty to conserve and sustainably use the marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction named as the high seas. The treaty is aimed at establishing a global legal mechanism to develop MPAs in international waters. 

While three negotiation sessions have taken place in the past three years, the fourth session – scheduled for March 2020 – had to be postponed due to restrictions imposed by the Coronavirus pandemic. With only one round of negotiation left for the UN treaty to take shape, it is highly anticipated to see how these new layer to the ocean governance framework will bring change.",1608269610.0,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/kff3dr/protecting_worlds_oceans_need_of_the_hour/,biodiversity,Positive
1fjjdci,Navigating New Horizons: A global foresight report on planetary health and human wellbeing ,"New report out from the United Nations Environment Programme.

Navigating New Horizons: A global foresight report on planetary health and human wellbeing 

What is foresight and how does it compare to prediction? 

""Prediction is passive: it means locking in a vision of the future. Foresight is about imagining the future and then looking at how to change it.""

Here, the report draws on a wide diversity of disciplines and voices to foresee the future. 

The report focuses on the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, but also combines with other key drivers of change, including social, technological, geopolitical, and AI, among many others. Indeed, we are facing a 'policrisis', whereby the triple planetary is impacting and exacerbating human crises like conflicts for resources and declining health. Taking a holistic view is important for understanding the whole situation. 

It identifies old and emerging challenges that require immediate attention and have the potential to drastically impact planetary health. Eight critical global shifts or phenomena that emerged from the foresight process.

1. The relationship between humans and the environment in flux

2. Critical resources: scarcity, competition and the shifting dynamics of global security

3. AI, digital transformation and technology – a wave of change

4. A new era of conflict

5. Mass forced displacement and migration

6. Persistent and widening inequalities

7. Misinformation, declining trust, and polarization

8. Polycentricity and diffusion of governance

""Adopting agile and reflexive governance—with shorter-term time-bound targets to enable course correction combined with multi-layered monitoring at the UN level—would significantly enhance achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Placing a new global emphasis on wellbeing metrics rather than pure economic growth will help the transformation needed. The future must be consultative, multilateral, cooperative and integrate the voices of traditionally marginalised groups, including women, youth, local communities and Indigenous Peoples.""

As far as I know, the main dangers of global warming are drought and rising sea levels. Pessimists predict that it would turn many places on earth into inhabitable wastelands and cause overcrowding and mass starvation.

But during the earth's history, average temperatures were substantially higher in prehistoric times and life thrived then. 50 million years ago average temperatures were about 14 C higher with one of the highest biodiversities in the Eocene Epoch. 

Would artificially created humidity extend the tropical and subtropical regions thus improving the ecosystem?

lrbksc,A few ideas outside the box to save the planet.,"1. Paint every top of the buiding with chrome paint, this will expell solar rays back out of the atmosphere to replace the mirror effect polar ice used to do.
2. The least productive land in the world  in terms of food production and live support is the one used for roads, cover the roads with solar pannels for energy production instead of using productive land for this purpose.
3. Reintroduce large mammals to semi dessertic lands, they will create a symbiotic live cicle that will make plants thrive again.
4. Plant fruit trees everywhere, they are huge supporters of life in general, most animals can feed from them and their manure fertilizes the land.
5. Implement a life tax: one person can eat 100 baby shrimps in one meal, the same person could be full with just 5 jumbo shrimps. By implementing the life tax (for example a tax of 3 cents per animals 1 pound or less, 1 dollar per animals 1 pound to 5 pounds, 5 dollars per animals 5 pounds to 25  etc) we would make smaller animals more expensive, forcing people to consume larger animals and at the same time collect money to be spent exclusively to protect biodiversity.
6.

I think there are multiple problems with their response and I'm in conversation with the authors via email.

The biggest problem, as I point out in a comment on this video from the skeptics' conference where my paper was mentioned, is that DICE and PAGE IAMs do include CO2 fertilization! It's a gross and misleading mischaracterization by them to say that they do not. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQLb-vUyG0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQLb-vUyG0)

My personal takeaways: the old IAMs are superseded by this: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05224-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05224-9), which shows that the SCC is at least a few 10s of $/tCO2, even with a high discount rate and including CO2 fertilization and adaptation.

Also, as I mention in my published paper, there are more damages to people at low latitudes and more benefits (reduced deaths from cold, more good farmland) to people at high latitudes. Also, climate change poses a threat to biodiversity, because animals cannot adapt like humans can.

pnsti5,how does the preservation of forests contribute to carbon emissions/climate change?,"I thought that when plants or animals died, they release their stored carbon back into the atmosphere, making the net carbon loss from their existence essentially zero, right?

I know that some forests and especially rainforests provide incredibly high biodiversity, but how does biodiversity result in less carbon emission if all the carbon is released once the organisms die anyways? (though I do know that in many places rainforests preserve climates of the past that would not exist were the plants to be removed, due to evapotranspiration & other factors).

But I bring this up because I know that certain environments like steppes and peatlands are very effective carbon sinks since when the plants die, their remains are buried by other growing plants, or are submerged in aerobic environments which prevent their decay and prevent the carbon from being released. But this doesn't happen so much in forests, does it? because, in general, in healthy forests the floor will be somewhat bare of grasses and other plants that bury remains like in steppes, right? So how is it that preserving forests helps to lower carbon emissions or prevent climate change?

ht7cvw,How does this work?,"I’m pretty ignorant when it comes to climate change. I’d greatly appreciate an explanation of how rising global temperatures will spell the end of civilisation as we know it. 

At present, my understanding is that the order of events is something like this:

1. Global (air and sea) temperatures rise

2. Polar and glacial ice melt, raising the global sea level

3. Rising sea levels wreak economic havoc by:
a.  Causing mass migration from low-lying population centres
b. Necessitating the construction of costly sea barriers around wealthier coastal cities

4. Rising sea temperature causes disruption of long-standing oceanic currents, leading to dramatic localised climate change. This is a problem because affected countries must alter their economies and economic output to reflect their new climate reality. This itself is a problem because the change in climate will occur faster than economies can keep up. 

5. Mass famine and starvation will result from the reduction in arable land brought about by rising temps. 

6. If newly suitable countries do not pick up the slack in terms of crop production, global food supply chains will dwindle. This will result in more starvation, and possibly war.

7. Sufficiently fast temperature changes (such as what we are now experiencing) will lead to the destabilisation of local and global ecosystems, and great reduction in biodiversity. This is a bad thing because we rely on these ecosystems for food. If they collapse, global food supply reduces to a point where the present global population cannot be supported.

8. Corollary of (6) and (7): Global temp increases will not lead to the creation of enough new arable land to grow enough crops to support global civilisation in its current form. In other words, arable land lost will not be equal to arable land gained.

w1lbkn,QUESTION REGARDING NITROGEN POLICIES IN THE NETHERLANDS,"The Dutch government is trying to combat the nitrogen problem by halving the livestock. While I am of course fully in favor of policies on combating climate change and promoting biodiversity, this policy nevertheless raised two essential questions for me.

Although nitrogen can be seen as a relatively local problem, 30-40% of nitrogen comes from abroad. The Netherlands itself has a lot of policy on nitrogen that farmers must adhere to. Significant progress has therefore been made in this area. Many other countries do not have this policy. The Netherlands also exports a lot to countries that would emit much more if they produced it themselves. When the livestock is halved; however, the demand for these goods will not decrease and the supply will shift. If this happens in countries where there are few or no measures regarding the responsible use of nitrogen in agriculture and livestock, is the amount of nitrogen not increasing? Or are we not deteriorating other places in the world for our own gain? Animal welfare is also less well organized in many other places in the world.

I also wonder how it is possible that the livestock here is halved, based on European regulations regarding nitrogen and sustainability, where farmers in other countries receive subsidies to expand from the same Europe. The same here too: different and less strict rules regarding nitrogen.

Why exactly should the livestock be halved here? Isn't it much more efficient to compete precisely for supply from areas where the correct nitrogen policy is not being pursued?

1ght2jb,Invasive species,"Let me preface this by saying I understand the value of natives for biodiversity. Life has evolved alongside them, so certain species depend on them. 

But Invasive species have been conquering more and more of the world. Many humans aim to remove them to make room for natives again. 

To me it seems they are not considering the whole picture. If humans were to die out one day, the invasives would just come back anyways. So basically all we did was just delay evolution & natural succession and messed a little bit with the gene pool. 

Invasives are here now. I know people claim they do literally nothing for biodiversity but that’s not true. Nature adapts fast. I’ve seen many non native hedges and trees provide great bird & bug habitat. Also, over time these species would become more and more interconnected within an ecosystem. Removing invasives sets this process back. And in times of rapid climate change, we really can’t afford losing precious evolutionary adaptation.

In my eyes, invasives are very valuable in the fight against climate change. Tree of heaven for example grows crazy fast, sucking up a lot of carbon. It’s a perfect tree for pollarding and using the sticks as an energy source (I.e. in a rocket stove) in a carbon negative way, since the roots remain in ground and you’re not killing the tree when you’re harvesting it’s wood. 

My point is, that removing invasives to plant natives doesn’t always make sense, if the natives don’t have their preferred range of conditions anymore in 50-100 years and will end up being replaced by better adapted invasives anyways.

weu16j,Have heard we are preventing an ice age right now.,"So I recognize the harms of manmade climate change and wish we weren't causing them. Issues like ocean acidification, rapidly warmer weather, erosion, change in water cycles, invasive species, etc, etc.

However, lets say we got our greenhouse gas production under control and could control the exact amount in the atmosphere. Would it be wise to remove all man made CO2? Or would it make sense to prevent additional warming but prevent us from going back into a natural ice age? It seems like an ice age would not be beneficial for our soecies or many others, just like how the rapid hesting of our planet isn't also. I could be wrong, but a warmer climate would promote more biodiversity, no? (While realizing a rapidly heating planet leads to biocollapse and kess biodiversity). If anything our species may not have came to be what it is today if we didn't have that brief warming peruod that allowed us to invent agriculture. Is the fact that it is a normal cycle being disrupted enough to justify going back intk an ice age if we had more power over our armospheres gasses? Similarly, if we could prevent an asteroid strike to save ourselves and preserve biodiversity, but would be preventing something natural.

Basically, no doubt we shouldn't contribute to the anthropocene, but if a natural mass extinction even were to happen that we coukd prevent, should we not also prevent that? Or even a less widespread extinction event like the cycle of glacial and inter-glacial periods? Would climate engineering to promote biodiversity become a bad idea if we removed the strong selecting forces of natural climate change, asteroid impacts, etc?

On a side note, if we could turn every desert into a rainforest with like 10 to 100 times the amount of unique species, with the sacrifice of desert species, should we do it? It would help reduce carbon and could keep desert areas more lush and habitable. Biodiversity is biosecurity, but without species adapted to a desert environment, if some unseen even turned Earth into a desert, we would have less species adapted to said environments.

Edit: I just want to clarify as it seems like people are assuming I am making an argument that I am not making. I am not promoting any positives of climate chabge as we all knkw they are mostly bad. I am talking about the positives of our climate 200 years ago, prior to the industreal revolution, over an ice age/glacial period. Not our world today or the future projections. Like, if we had complete control over our climate and with the push of a button stopped man made climate change, would it also be beneficial to stop the glacial period we would be heading into in 50 000 to 100 000 years? It seems like we would have more farmable land and more rainforest and biodiversity not having glaciers stretch to the equator (while realizing we are going through the anthropocene and mass extinction from our current, rappid warming, as well as things like erosion, floods, dtought, fire, etc which are not good for farming, biodiversity, or humans).",1659492570.0,0,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/weu16j/have_heard_we_are_preventing_an_ice_age_right_now/,biodiversity,Positive

At this point, every few months a hurricane that requires evacuation hits Florida and I’m not even sure it’s worth living there now that weather seems to be getting worse.

1e6mpwf,I feel we are close to the point were Air conditioning won't be able to combat the heat.,"I do not even live in a super hot climate. I live in Mass on the east coast. Almost every day this summer has been 90F. It was not long ago that our summers were 75 and maybe a week in the 80s. Not only is it 90F but 60% humidity on a daily basis.. I understand weather fluctuates but this seems pretty extreme for such a small amount of time. In the next 10 years is 100-120F just going to be the norm? I know some places in Arizona are completely inhabitable at this point because no AC unit can combat 120F temperatures.

Edit: A big part of why I posted this is because I do home theater installs in peoples houses and for majority of this whole summer 90% of the houses I went into did not have adequate AC felt like it was 80 in the house. But besides that what about people that are unable to be in AC. I personally felt like I was close to a heat stroke multiple times during this summer. Obviously there is no quick fix and with how divided everyone is this will never get solved but I am just trying to understand or accept that this is reality now. You need to work in extreme heat on the edge of heat exhaustion and heat stroke just to fulfill your daily tasks.

It's disgusting how mounting species decline, even extinction, is so little discussed by American politicians and even the media.  Even collapsing fisheries doesn't merit concern, or even the degradation of the national parks.

Are Florida politicians, let alone national politicians, indifferent to the destruction of the Great Florida Reef, one of the nation's great natural assets?

EDIT:  Several of the comments reinforce my point.  A majority of Americans, as evidenced by the lack of concern among politicians and media, don't seem to understand the gravity of climate change impacts on the environment, living things, and certainly mankind.  E.g., a decline in the bird population will likely increase insect populations, negatively impacting among a host of things, agricultural production unless pesticide use increases greatly.

Saw this article just recently, and wondered whether the decline in the bird population also was a factor, although much warmer winters clearly is reducing winter kill-offs of insects.

<<McDermott says the dramatic rise of tick-borne diseases in Ohio is happening for a combination of reasons.

First, there are more ticks in the state.

Because of factors like climate change and reforestation, Ohio has more habitat for ticks than it did just a few decades ago. As a result, ticks are thriving here, McDermott said.

“Ohio is really on the forefront of tick expansion,” he said. “We went from one tick of medical importance to humans, companion animals and livestock 20 years ago, which was the American dog tick, to five nowadays, including adding two new ticks in just the last few years.”

Plus, a lot of those ticks are carrying diseases.>>

nkwc0z,The shocking warming of Brazil,"Hello, folks. I'm a Socio-environmental Sciences student in Brazil and I always liked researching our climate here so I'm sharing with you some interesting facts:

According to NOAA, some states in Brazil have warmed more than 3.5°C and as much as +5°C from 1960 to 2020! Only one state (Santa Catarina) has experienced no observable warming on their annual average temperatures over the period, but mostly all states are at least 1°C warmer in 60 years.

From colonial documents sent to the portuguese court in the 1500s, where today is the São Paulo city, it never went more than 4 days in a row without rain during dry season. Today, São Paulo's dry season can bring up to 100 days in a row without rain, but mostly at least 30 days in a row. 

Other colonial documents describe a snowstorm in Ouro Preto at lattitudes 20°S, 1200m in elevation back in the 1700s. In the same century, there is also a document about observed snow sent to the court talking about snow where today is the brazilian capital Brasília, at 1100m high and 15°S.

In the 1800s, when most of the atlantic forest (mata atlântica) was being deforested, São Paulo already had a dry season, but according to priest's documents sent to the portuguese: in winter the city's puddles would turn into solid ice and there was snow at the surrounding peaks. Take a look at São Paulo's weather now, it's winter there and I guarantee you snow at the peaks there is so unheard of it sounds like fantasy. Students have gathered newspapers and journals for the time and found that up until the 1900s the main topics in those were extreme cold! Yes, the Brazilian most populous areas are in the transition zone between tropical and subtropical, but the combination of medium to high elevation and the potency of the Antarctic continent made it sometimes too cold that it would shock even the German, the latter fact being taken from early colonial documents. 

In the 1900s the first meteorology stations were inaugurated in Brazil. Then, it was already much warmer than the period between 1500-1800 and this has nothing to with the little ice age as there are recent studies showing ""the little ice age""(scientists hate that term) didn't affect the weather much outside of Europe and certainly not in South America.

Anyways, those early 20th century meteorology stations still recorded temperatures up to 6°C lower than today's on average, even in places which decreased their population until the 21st century. 
I live in a city which was classified as highland tropical (cwb koppen), it is what I studied in school and what I saw my whole life. But just the past 10 years added to our averages, made the 60 year average not classify as highland tropical anymore and it's now fully tropical (Aw). Ten years ago, during a strong La Niña (which brings colder than average weather for my region), I was having almost daily highs of 18°C and lows of 6°C by this time of the year. Today we are also going through the effects of one of the strongest La Niñas on record and I'm getting highs of 28°C and lows of 18°C, just to illustrate the complete shift between highland tropical and tropical climate. It's not a coincidence a study done with the help from the University of Yale in Brazil has come to the conclusion that 92% of Brazilians admit the effects of global warming are undeniable, even tho we have very poor education, with 95% confidence.

In the past erased time before the 1900s, Brazil has seen a lot of snow, frost, freezing fog and ice, all of which are basically extinct today. I'm 26 years old and I have lived enough to experience a dramatic shift in the climate pattern here in my lifetime. Ten years ago today, I hadn't experienced temperatures above 35°C in my city, the all time high here was 36°C once in a period of 110 years. Nowadays, that mark is reached or surpassed almost every single year since 2012, with a new all time high of 38°C.

In Brazil we experience a combination of green house gas warming effect with deforestation (in colonial times, the atlantic forest and now, the Amazon) which has led us to out of this world warming together with lack of rain. More heat + less rain = a lot less water. Brazil is on the verge of lacking water entirely as today even regions who received rain year-round, like south Brazil, are on a drought and rationing water. The Amazon deforestation is at record high rates since president Bolsonaro took office, his opposed candidate, Fernando Haddad, had a plan for zero deforestation in Brazil back in 2018 when scientists were saying the Amazon was on the verge of collapsing being just at 20% of loss of its area. Now, we are much past beyond those 20% marks in which the collapse inevitably begins. The atlantic forest has lost 97% of its area since the 1500s. The most forested state outside the Amazon region, has 30% of their area covered in forest (Rio de Janeiro). Brazil went from being an international example in forest protection and environmentalism to being the world pariah in the past 5 years.

There are a lot more interesting facts I could share but this is long enough for a Reddit post.

Let's have fun going extinct together!

* FAQ:  [IPCC\_AR6\_WGI\_FAQs](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/faqs/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQs.pdf)

With the release of the AR6 report there will undoubtedly be a flood of commentary covering different aspects and findings in the report. This will be the first, of what I hope to be a series of posts, once every Monday, covering the top-line conclusions of the report, chapter by chapter.

This will not in any way be a comprehensive overview of the AR6 report, if you want that, then just read the SPM or TS! Instead, I simply plan to skim the report and find what sticks out to me as particularly interesting developments. I hope these posts will also serve as places of wider discussion of the much anticipated updated assessment.

\_\_\_

For this first post I want to begin with what most people will probably read, the Summary for Policymakers. Rather than just regurgitating the headline findings I think it would be interesting to see how our knowledge has been updated since the previous AR5 report. So here is a breakdown of the notable improvements and updates in the AR6 SPM compared to the AR5 SPM.

**Greater emphasis placed on ""human influence""**

This is not so much a change in the science as it is a change in the IPCC's presentation. Whereas the dominant role of human influence in causing climate change was previously restricted to the more sterile term ""anthropogenic,"" the AR6 SPM prefers the terms ""human-caused"" and ""human influence."" Throughout the report the role of humanity is emphasized more often, and is quantified with greater confidence, primarily due to the rapid advances in event attribution and climate attribution science over the last decade.

AR6

>It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.

AR5

>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased

**Another record breaking decade**

AR6

>Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 \[0.84- 1.10\] °C higher than 1850-19009 . Global surface temperature was 1.09 \[0.95 to 1.20\] °C higher in 2011– 2020 than 1850–1900, with larger increases over land (1.59 \[1.34 to 1.83\] °C) than over the ocean (0.88 \[0.68 to 1.01\] °C).

AR5

>Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850 (see Figure SPM.1).

**An updated range of ECS (finally!)**

Roughly speaking, equilibrium climate sensitivity quantifies the global temperature response to the radiative forcing of a doubling of CO2. For decades the likely range of ECS has remained largely unchanged. Unlike AR5, AR6 provides a best estimate for ECS of 3°C.

AR6

>The equilibrium climate sensitivity is an important quantity used to estimate how the climate responds to radiative forcing. Based on multiple lines of evidence, the very likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity is between 2°C (high confidence) and 5°C (medium confidence). The AR6 assessed best estimate is 3°C with a likely range of 2.5°C to 4°C (high confidence). . .

AR5

>Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C (high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C (medium confidence)

**New scenarios, new futures**

AR6:

>Compared to 1850–1900, global surface temperature averaged over 2081–2100 is very likely to be higher by 1.0°C to 1.8°C under the very low GHG emissions scenario considered (SSP1-1.9), by 2.1°C to 3.5°C in the intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5) and by 3.3°C to 5.7°C under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). **The last time global surface temperature was sustained at or above 2.5°C higher than 1850–1900 was over 3 million years ago (medium confidence).**

AR5:

>Relative to the average from year 1850 to 1900, global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st century is projected to likely exceed 1.5°C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence). Warming is likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence), more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5 (high confidence), but unlikely to exceed 2°C for RCP2.6 (medium confidence). Warming is unlikely to exceed 4°C for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 (high confidence) and is about as likely as not to exceed 4°C for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {12.4}

**1.5 and 2°C substantially more likely to be exceeded under SSP/RCP than previous RCPs**

AR6:

>Global warming of 1.5°C relative to 1850-1900 *would be exceeded* during the 21st century under the intermediate, high and very high scenarios considered in this report (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively).

AR5:

>Relative to the average from year 1850 to 1900, global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st century is projected to likely exceed 1.5°C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence).

AR6:

>Based on the assessment of multiple lines of evidence, global warming of 2°C, relative to 1850– 1900, *would be exceeded* during the 21st century under the high and very high GHG emissions scenarios considered in this report (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Global warming of 2°C would *extremely likely* be exceeded in the intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5).

AR5:

>Warming is *likely* to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence), *more likely than not* to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5 (high confidence).

**Improved observational evidence that human-caused climate change is already having impacts**

AR6:

>**Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.** Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, **their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5.**  
>  
>It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, with high confidence that human-induced climate change is the main driver14 of these changes. **Some recent hot extremes observed over the past decade would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate system**. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s (high confidence), and human influence has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006.  
>  
>The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land area for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis (high confidence), and human-induced climate change is likely the main driver. **Human-induced climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration** (medium confidence).  
>  
>It is likely that the global proportion of major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last four decades, and the latitude where tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific reach their peak intensity has shifted northward; **these changes cannot be explained by internal variability alone** (medium confidence).  
>  
>Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s. This includes increases in the **frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale (high confidence)**; fire weather in some regions of all inhabited continents (medium confidence); and compound flooding in some locations (medium confidence).

**Human impacts on the cryosphere**

AR6:

>Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019 (about 40% in September and about 10% in March). There has been no significant trend in Antarctic sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 due to regionally opposing trends and large internal variability. Human influence very likely contributed to the decrease in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since 1950. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, but there is only limited evidence, with medium agreement, of human influence on the Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss.

A projection of when the Arctic might become nearly ice-free in September in the 21st century cannot be made with confidence for the other scenarios. {11.3, 12.4, 12.5}

t3go0i,This one quote from the IPCC report,"Human-induced climate change, including more frequent and intense extreme events, has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond natural climate variability. Some development and adaptation efforts have reduced vulnerability. Across sectors and regions the most vulnerable people and systems are observed to be disproportionately affected. The rise in weather and climate extremes has led to some irreversible impacts as natural and human systems are pushed beyond their ability to adapt.

>A 4-5% increase in hurricane winds may not seem like a big deal, but damage from a hurricane increases exponentially with an increase in winds. For example, according to NOAA, a Category 2 hurricane with 100 mph (161 kph) winds will do 10 times the damage of a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph (121 kph) winds. This includes damage not only from winds but also from storm surge, inland flooding, and tornadoes. **Bottom line: A 4-5% increase in winds yields about a 40-50% increase in hurricane damage** (Figure 1).

A northern shift in the jet stream due to climate change (Arctic Amplification) also may negatively impact agricultural production.  As the jet stream creates wind shear which suppresses hurricanes, a northern shift in the jet stream also may increase the frequency of hurricanes.

1gliod5,Is the rise of populism in developed countries a direct result of climate change…?!,"In all this talk about Trump being bad for reducing the immediate and medium term impacts of global warming, I am wondering if there is an argument to be made that his election as well as the rise of populism in Europe over the last few years is a direct or at least partial consequence of climate change.

Hear me out: there have been weather catastrophes of increasing impact and frequency for the better part of this century that are unquestionably driven by climate change (e.g. extreme heat in PNW, UK, Desert Southwest in the last few years, extreme drought in the Brazilian Amazon etc.). 

The mitigation of and recovery from those catastrophes requires increasingly more resources, which in turn drive inflation, disrupt supply chains and so on. Additionally, people are facing increasing restrictions in their day to day lives to avoid the impacts of climate change (take again extreme heat as an example that requires people to stay indoors with AC for the better part of a given day). 

Our thus far short-sighted, and inadequate response to these challenges has given a lot of space to people with simple answers by claiming it’s all a lie or easily dealt with because we are supposedly adaptable as a species or whatever else. 

All this to ask from a sociological perspective: Are we as a common people seeing the effects of climate change on our society already? Moreover, is global warming the underlying driver of the societal shift toward nationalism in Western and developed nations? And if so, isn’t this inevitably driving us into throwing bombs on one each other down the road?

zyd921,Higher Heatwave Potential,"The past several years Earth has gone through a rare triple year La Nina cycle, which has caused a cooling effect on the entire planet. Coastal Sea surface temperatures on Western Coastlines got as low as 47F in areas that are typically 56F+. This has kept the effects of global warming mild in recent years. Unfortunately weather models are now predicting a chance of El Nino, which has the opposite effect. An El Nino immediately after years of record drought would cause a very severe fire risk and potentially lethal heatwaves. 

Our group of college climatologists & ecologists have identified at least one reliable heat refuge within a 20-30 mile range of Pacific Northwest coastal communities stretching from Mendocino CA up to Coos Bay OR. Those areas allow marine air to be trapped by the nearby mountain range, which offers a natural barrier from extreme heatwaves. Those areas must have 2,000ft-4,000ft mountains within a 30 mile distance to the coastline to maintain this effect. They also exist along a flat geologic coastal feature that allows for a cool upwelling of deep ocean water into the area carried by Easterly winds. Those regions offer a mild seasonal temperature swing between 50F-75F annually. It acts almost like a bubble keeping high pressure heatwave influence out.

Locations hit hardest by heat will likely be areas that are already susceptible to extreme hot and dry weather. It is often a misconception that Northern regions only allow cooler temperatures, while overall that is true do to longer cold seasons, it is only consistently true near the poles. Last year Canada experienced a heatwave of 121F, the following days wildfires broke out. Meanwhile nearby coastal communities were still in the 60F-70F range.

17hzo08,How would you prepare civilization for climate change if it wasn't human caused?,"I think a lot of climate change deniers have been forced to change their view over the years due to all the obvious evidence in front of their own eyes. They've gone from denying outright that it isn't happening to accepting it is happening, but denying that it is human caused. So let's explore that angle.

Ok. The climate is warming and the weather is getting more extreme. Ocean levels are rising, but we'll ignore that CO2 is making them more acidic because we can't explain away that one. Well that sucks. Now we need to prepare ourselves for a climate change that we have no way of reversing. Now what?

We can't rely on big single sources of electricity that require long distance infrastructure to provide power since those are easily disrupted by bad weather events. We'll need a localized grid so that only small parts are taken out at a time. More local solar, wind, and storage makes sense since it can function without far away inputs like a natural gas or coal plant needs.

Also makes sense to have your vehicles electrified for the same reason. They are self sufficient locally for a time even if a large area is hit and road distribution networks are disrupted for several weeks. Food production should also be more localized and self sufficient for this reason.

And since we can't stop the oceans from rising, we don't need the XL pipeline built to send crude to the refineries on the coast since they will be under water soon anyway.

So then I read the article about the AMOC potentially slowing down and collapsing this century, and that this would lead to significantly lower temperatures in northern Europe.

16d4lh1,Hot Take: Climate Change itself is one giant feedback loop.,"So I’m sitting here thinking.. As extreme weather events exponentially increase across the globe, thus increases the damage to infrastructure and property. In the majority of cases, the damage will be replaced or rebuilt (devastatingly, some individuals or areas will not be able to afford to do this - losing everything). This rebuilding and replacing process uses a lot of resources and embodied Carbon that goes into the process of replacing or rebuilding. Therefore, increasing green house gas emissions, which in turn will worsen the climate emergency.

I’m sat here mulling over the vast quantities of items, infrastructure, property, vehicles etc that will be replaced in the coming years. It’s in our nature to rebuild and replace.. to grow and not recede. 

Are there articles and studies on this already? (I went straight to reddit, rather than google)

Have models taken into account the increased CO2 emissions of the embodied Carbon that goes into replacing damaged infrastructure and property? Because I don’t see a way of calculating or predicting such data. 

For some context: I am a carpenter in Australia, currently renovating a damaged property from the record breaking and biblical floods that happened in Feb 2022. The town was devastated - the residential property I’m working on the waters were up to head height on the First floor. The entire town needed renovating, cars replaced, bridges made safe, new drainage, roads resurfaced, all personal property replaced.. the list goes on. This town had similar, yet ever so slightly smaller serious floods like this in 1954, 74 and 2017. With numerous other occasions over the towns history the levees being broken and damage happening.
The town is guaranteed to flood again (probably the next La Niña) - the months of work, travel and vast quantities of materials going into this one house must have quite the Carbon Footprint.. and this will be ruined and destroyed at the next flood. This cycle must be playing itself out all over the globe, or if it’s not the same town being rebuilt it’s the one next door. 

I can’t help but feel helpless and depressed when I think about this perpetual cycle.. how can you ever hit net zero if we’re constantly rebuilding?",1694160796.0,25,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/16d4lh1/hot_take_climate_change_itself_is_one_giant/,extreme weather,Negative
1bl9c2l,How melting Arctic ice leads to European drought and heatwaves,"
""She [Oltmanns] said warmth over Greenland in the summer of 2023 melted a lot of ice, sending more freshwater toward the North Atlantic.

The coming extremes will probably be similar to the European heatwaves of 2018 and 2022, she added, when there were huge temperature spikes in the Scandinavian and Siberian Arctic, as well as unusual wildfires in far northern Sweden. That year, much of the Northern Hemisphere was scorched, with “22 percent of populated and agricultural areas simultaneously experiencing heat extremes between May and July,” according to a 2019 study in Nature.""



""[...] “In most of the thinking, in particular in the general public, a weakening of the AMOC is associated with colder conditions in Europe that could locally dampen the impact of global warming,” he [Fettweia] said. But the new paper suggests the contrary, he added. Larger amounts of freshwater moving from the Arctic to Atlantic “could perturb the general circulation in summer favoring heatwave and droughts.”""

n3vrnt,Attribution of the Australian bushfire risk to anthropogenic climate change,"From the abstract:

>Therefore, we find that climate change has induced a higher weather-induced risk of such an extreme fire season. This trend is mainly driven by the increase of temperature extremes. In agreement with previous analyses we find that heat extremes have become more likely by at least a factor of 2 due to the long-term warming trend. However, current climate models overestimate variability and tend to underestimate the long-term trend in these extremes, so the true change in the likelihood of extreme heat could be larger, suggesting that the attribution of the increased fire weather risk is a conservative estimate. We do not find an attributable trend in either extreme annual drought or the driest month of the fire season, September–February. The observations, however, show a weak drying trend in the annual mean. For the 2019/20 season more than half of the July–December drought was driven by record excursions of the Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Annular Mode, factors which are included in the analysis here. The study reveals the complexity of the 2019/20 bushfire event, with some but not all drivers showing an imprint of anthropogenic climate change.

https://www.spiked-online.com/2022/02/15/why-global-warming-is-good-for-us/

There's a lot of uncited claims in here (CO2 created more plant growth etc as a net positive, storms aren't actually getting worse according to the IPCC), yet I don't have succinct retorts to this style of random assertion. I know cereals hate more CO2 (yields will lower) etc, harming food supplies.

> as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) repeatedly confirms, there is no clear pattern of storms growing in either frequency or ferocity, droughts are decreasing slightly and floods are getting worse only where land-use changes

a7l4w7,Which climate scientists have most influenced you?,"I'll share a list of mine and some highlights of how they have shaped my understanding.

1. John Tyndall

Over 150 years ago, he demonstrated the greenhouse effect of GHG's like CO2. 


2. James Hansen

Generally, his passion for the topic has caused me to dig deeper.


3. Dr. Jennifer Francis - Rutgers

Her explanation of how climate change is effecting weather patterns, specifically via altering the Jet Stream and Circumpolar wind currents resulting in stuck weather patterns (more extreme rainfall and heat waves)

4. Karen Pistone

Led a 2014 study quantifying the impact of lost albedo in the Arctic which concluded that lost albedo was causing warming equivalent to 50% of all cumulative anthropogenic emissions.

5. Dr. Eric Rignot - NASA and UCI

His specialty is the satellite and radar measurement of the cryosphere. A few years back he claimed that big portions of W. Antarctica were melting irreversibly. Digging into this claim and understanding the ocean / ice interface and the topography under the ice sheets tipped me into a heightened concern about climate change 2 years ago.

Some of his work incorporates the work of Jennifer Francis and the understanding of how changing ocean currents are bringing warm water to the ice sheets.

6. DeConto and Pollard

Developed the theory of Marine Ice Sheet Instability which is a potential missing link in understanding how ice sheets can rapidly disintegrate as they have in recent geologic past. ~ 15k years ago, sea levels rose ~ 1 foot per decade for ~ 500 years. 

That ice is now long gone and we won't see an exact repeat of that. But they have put together a lot of elements which help modelers reconcile their warming models to past sea level rise. 

The proof will be in the data in the coming decade or two. Just a theory for now.

7. Dr. Kerry Emanuel MIT

His specialty is in extreme weather and hurricane prediction. His work points to more intense and wet storms resulting from climate change, albeit with less storm formation intensity. 

8. Jeff Donnelly, Woods Hole

Has made strides in paleo-evidence of hurricane activity. Using ocean holes where sediments collect, he's able to reconstruct storm activity for several millennia. Combining that with oxygen isotope ratios which enable a reconstruction of ocean temperatures, a solid relationship between storm intensity and ocean temperature.

9. Charles Keeling and historical CO2 mappers. 

CO2 isn't the only GHG, but it's a good proxy. Understanding the GHG's are at a 5M year high and likely to hit a 20M year high in my lifetime is pretty significant. 

That's my core list. I'm interested to add to that list based upon the feedback of others.

This person is not a denier of climate change at all, and their response when taken as a whole indicates as much. 

That said, while there is a difference between weather (the totality of the phenomena outside right now) and climate (weather patterns over extended timeframes), at the same time, the long-term change has clearly been noted by climate scientists. There is almost universal agreement that the extreme weather worldwide this season is due in large part to man-made climate change. 

I get that we all use the term “climate change” instead of “global warming” due to all the idiots in the winter who scream, “Global warming my ass!” That said, especially when looking at trends and projections, pointing out that weather and climate are different when referring to climate change, in this case, seems to miss the mark.",1691168790.0,20,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/15i5ov5/weather_is_not_climate_at_this_point_does_that/,extreme weather,Negative

>Drip by drip, steady ice loss in the Arctic and sub-Arctic is injecting enormous quantities of meltwater into the North Atlantic Ocean. Researchers have now shown how all that fresh water ultimately drives more extreme summer weather over Europe. These results might enable better long-term weather predictions in Europe, the team concluded.   
          
>Every year, the Arctic and sub-Arctic lose several hundred cubic kilometers, on average, of both sea ice and glacial ice due to rising temperatures. The fresh water liberated by all that melting eventually enters the North Atlantic, where it aggregates into so-called freshwater anomalies. Those structures, which tend to lurk on the surface of the ocean because of their relatively low density, can measure thousands of kilometers in extent and several tens of meters deep in winter.   
            
>Freshwater anomalies in the North Atlantic have been shown to [precede European heat waves](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab4d33 ""https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab4d33""). However, the mechanism—or mechanisms—behind that linkage has long remained unknown, said [Marilena Oltmanns](https://noc.ac.uk/n/Marilena+Oltmanns ""https://noc.ac.uk/n/Marilena+Oltmanns""), an ocean and climate scientist at the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom. That question is increasingly relevant given [rapidly warming temperatures in the Arctic](https://eos.org/science-updates/understanding-causes-and-effects-of-rapid-warming-in-the-arctic ""https://eos.org/science-updates/understanding-causes-and-effects-of-rapid-warming-in-the-arctic"") and recent weather extremes—such as [heat waves and droughts](https://eos.org/editor-highlights/dry-soils-enhanced-the-2018-heatwave-in-northern-europe ""https://eos.org/editor-highlights/dry-soils-enhanced-the-2018-heatwave-in-northern-europe"")—that have occurred in Europe, Oltmanns and her colleagues suggested.

>Gushing from Greenland

The seasonal signals that they noted were consistent with melting in the summer and then propagation of that meltwater south, via ocean currents, the following winter. Freshwater anomalies have a pronounced effect at latitudes between 25°N and 65°N, the team showed.      
         
>When Oltmanns and her colleagues focused on the 10 warmest and coldest summers in Europe over the past 4 decades, they found that warmer summers tended to follow winters characterized by larger freshwater anomalies, colder freshwater anomalies, and stronger northward deflection of westerly winds.

qw5a92,"Question on Climate Change in the Great Lakes Basin, North America (Canada)","As a Canadian, I am following the news out of southern BC closely in terms of the catastrophic flooding caused by climate change. I live in the great lakes area in the snow belt region. I was wondering: since our winters seem to be having a later and later start but lasting longer into the spring (ie. late April blizzards), and the lakes are at record warm levels for this time of year, meaning that with no ice coverage, when cool weather arrives we will have more intense precipitation in the winter in the form of lake effect snow. It is not super uncommon for periodic snowfalls where overnight you get \~5 feet and it just keeps coming down. I have seen climate change projections for the great lakes basin area and they explain how modelling shows a decrease in precipitation during the summer months and an increase in the winter months as I outlined above due to warmer temps, but not cold enough to freeze lakes. Combine that with increases in extreme weather events, is it possible that we could witness a catastrophic phenomenon of a ""mega snow"" event to coin a term? In other words, under these conditions in the near to medium future, could we possibly see like a 10 ft plus snow fall event overnight in an extreme locked in snowsquall? Could this be life threatening? Obviously on the roads it would be, but I mean to the point of requiring evac in your home like a flood situation? Also would the increase in temps make a rare cyclonic storm event developing over Lake Huron much more likely like the "" The 1996 Lake Huron Cyclone, commonly referred to as Hurricane Huron and Hurroncane"" I'd imagine the answer is yes. Another part of my long winded question is even though the great lakes basin sit well above sea level, is it possible that with the increase in precipitation that we could also see inland flooding caused by this? Obviously no one has a crystal ball and my formal education on this is limited to a couple of environmental science courses and natural hazards mitigation and climate courses I took in university as electives, so I am hoping for a more detailed and technical answer from someone who really knows their stuff.

In Germany (or in the EU?), the enclosure of chickens is a mandatory label on eggs. With that, in my perception, the offer for eggs of higher standards increased by customer choice. And this is because the customer got the info from box and could choose and therefor tell the producers, what the market demands. Unfortunately I don’t have a source on that, but as I said, it is my understanding. This continues on meat and maybe even with the Nutriscore…

Now for climate change, I expect similar results if there is a carbon footprint label on all products. Speaking for myself, I don’t know, how much energy is used for different types of fruits, vegetables etc. There is a label on country of origin, but e.g. ananas can be from the same county but some come ripe via plane and others ripe on the ship giving significantly different carbon footprints. I know, the manufacturers won’t be happy for that but we need to change our way of living anyway….

With this post I aim for multiple things:
- what’s your opinion on that?
- are the sources / scientific studies on carbon footprint of all kinds of foods? Can we start a collection on such data?

pq05mu,VOC profiling and reducing to CO2,"Hey guys,

I'm running a project with a company that are market leaders in the coatings and paint industry. During production they use a wide variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for their paint recipes. When they are used in production or when the batches are cleaned in cleaning buildings, a lot of these VOCs are emitted to the environment. 

A project they did last year was the addition of active carbon filters to the ventilation systems of one of the buildings, which resulted in great reduction of VOCs. But the costs are also really expensive. There is another way to break down the VOCs, that is with UV-C or fotolyses using UV lamps. This process transforms the VOCs into CO2 and H2O when the compound is oxidated (see illustration below). 

&#x200B;

The problem with this type of reaction is that you still have carbon dioxide that you emit to the environment. But the VOCs that the companies use are in a wide range of species not limited to; esters, ketones, alcohols, alphates, aromatics, etc. 

My question is, does anyone know a database or person who knows what the correction factor could be for various types of VOCs when compared to CO2. Some components might not be so bad for the environment (as they might not oxidate the ozon layer) but some components might be much more harmful for the environment when compared to CO2. 

This way we can look if it is handy to apply this technique to reduce the VOC concentration to CO2 and Water instead of emitting the original compounds. I'm really curious if this could be a way to reduce the harmfullness of the emission we produce.

ohz8ar,Digital tokens can extend carbon markets to small scale farmers,"Digital tokens offer opportunities to quickly and inexpensively extend carbon markets to small scale farmers by tokenising carbon credits and transacting via decentralised, trusted and expedient blockchain platforms.

A Brazilian start up - Agrorobotica - has built a printer sized device that can measure soil carbon levels in minutes. A pickup truck drills soils samples which are transported back to the lab for carbon level testing. This type of easy and inexpensive testing can help small scale farmers add a carbon crop to their produce. 

Farmer can earn credits from these practices and sell them on markets to companies looking to offset their own emissions. Currently there is no national carbon market in Brazil but voluntary markets allow companies to buy carbon credits to offset their emissions. A national market will extend market opportunities for farmers. COP26 in Glasgow in November is expected to bring in a new standard for carbon pricing and trading .This will create incentives for farmers to improve their sustainability, improve their reputation, increase income and address global warming. Regenerative farming techniques such as crop rotation, constant cover crops, low tillage are needed to enhance the carbon content of soils.

As an example of the demand for these markets, Brazilian coffee farmers that are growing certified sustainable coffee are getting up to 50% more on the price of their beans due to the growing demand from consumers.

Ive been looking into this since I am in this situation, and it seems that if you are likely to use your gas car for several more years (it's not about to die), it is better to replace it with an electric car because the emissions of producing the car and battery are outweighed by the emissions of gas.

However, what I still don't get is if someone gets rid of a gas car, they will be selling it on the used car market assuming it still works. Won't it still be in circulation and still be emitting carbon emissions, potentially more than before if the driver is not high-mpg oriented? I only seen an answer to this point in one source (a YouTube video) and it said we shouldn't worry about that because it is out of our control - we don't know what will happen to it, and how low of a mpg car the buyer might be upgrading from.

That response doesn't really broadly help answer the question however. Would the best thing for individuals with a working gas car be to sell it and get an electric car, or to keep the car until it dies?",1684701069.0,2,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/13o5fyd/selling_working_gas_car_to_go_electric_from_full/,carbon market,Positive

1xfj82,Great reporting on climate change issues,"Thank you so much for interviewing Bill McKibben at a time when in-depth reporting on climate change issues is a rarity. I hope you can do more reporting on climate change issues in the future.  If we don't quickly address climate change, we won't have a liveable planet, and then most other issues we worry about won't matter. 

For the best solutions on how to mitigate climate change, Bill McKibben has endorsed another rapidly growing grassroots environmental organization, Citizens Climate Lobby (CCL). McKibben has stated: ""I love working with Citizens Climate Lobby -- their relentless focus on the need for a fee-and-dividend solution is helping drive the debate in precisely the right direction. I'm enormously grateful for their persistence and creativity.""  (www.CitizensClimateLobby.org)  CCL is also endorsed by one of the world best known climate scientists, Dr. James Hansen. 

As a follow up to this show, could you do an interview with the executive director of Citizens Climate Lobby, Mark Reynolds?

Citizens Climate Lobby's mission is ""1) To create the political will for a stable climate, and 2) to empower individuals to have breakthroughs in exercising their personal and political power.""  They teach citizens how to bring back government into the hands of the people.   They also advocate reducing carbon emissions by charging a steadily rising fee (some call it a tax) on carbon emissions, but all the proceeds go back to each household in the form dividend payments so it does not grow the size of the government.  This market-based approach is recognized by economists to be the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions, and has the support of both conservative and liberal economists, including: George Shultz, Gary Becker, Gregory Mankiw,Art Laffer, Nicholas Stern, and Shi-Ling Hsu. (http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/08/conservative-economists-write-op-ed-in-support-of-carbon-tax/)

CCL has been doubling their membership each year, and now has over 150 local volunteer groups all over the U.S, Canada, and other countries.  CCL director Mark Reynolds was recently interviewed by Thom Hartmann (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E92QTvlvRmo), and CCL has appeared in the New York Times (http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/lobbying-for-the-greater-good/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1) and other newspapers across the country.

Thanks to multilayer design formed from different species forest can reaching this efficiency.

But crop plants  have lower ratio due single species and in most cases sunlight reaching soil, lets assume 63.2% of light is change to heat.

We have 10% more heat converted from sun light per each square inch, now  35% of Land changed from forest to Crop Plans 

3.5–7.0kW * daily sun energy let use 5kw
 52 129 000 000 000m2  x 5kW  x10% = 26 064,5 TW more heat per each day
How much is it a lot lets compare to how much energy we generated in 2015 = 168 519  TW per day 473 TW our change to forest generate 55,1  more heat that our entire technical civilization

pbhmja,"Planting trees is pointless, but I might have a much better solution.","Many people think planting trees is a good idea, but with a bit of math you easily see that this is pointless. There is in total 3208 billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere, and of this 1074 billion tons are from us humans. So how many trees would it take to do that?

The mass of a larger tree is around 9t, 40% of which, or 3.6T is dry mass which for simplicity we assume are carbohydrates with the simplified chemical formular C(H2O). So how much carbohydrates would have to grow to remove the 1074 billion tons of CO2? And how many trees would that be? To know that, we have to multiply the mass of CO2 with the molar mass of C(H2O) = 30g divided by the molar mass of CO2 =44g, then divide that by the dry mass of a tree.

1074 billion tons \* (30g/44g) = 732 billion tons of carbohydrates

732 billion tons / 3.6T = 203 billion trees!

You would need 10 thousand team trees to do that. Also each tree needs around 6m (50ft) of space around it, so one tree would need (6m)² \* π = 113m² (1214ft²) of land, this times 203 billion trees would be a 23 million km² (8.9 million mi²) forest we would have to plant, which is 4 times the size of the amazon rainforest. I don't think we even have that much land to spare where trees could grow. I think came up with something that might actually be realistic and would love to know what you guys think.

**An alternative solution**

Trees grow rather slowly, an average hardwood tree takes about 15 to 20 years to reach 9 tons, so why not plant something that grows faster, like bamboo? The fastest growing plant is a chinese bamboo tree that grows up to one meter or 3 foot a day and grows to 25 to 30m in a months. With a diameter of 25cm (10 inches) one meter weights 30Kg (66lbs), with a water content of around 50% that's 15kg (33lbs) of dry mass (carbohydrates), so a mature tree would have around 0.8 tons (1800lbs) of dry mass, and it needs only about 1.7m² of land. So if we would wanna remove all 1074 billion tons of CO2 at once, how many bamboo trees and how much land would we need? So we already know we would need to grow 732 billion tons of carbohydrates to remove all that CO2.

732 billion tons / 0.8 tons = 915 billion bamboo trees

915 billion \* 1.7m² = 1556 billion m² = 1.556 million km² 

So in theory with bamboo we would only need around 1.6 million km² (600 thousand mi²) which is almost 14 times less then with trees as well as 20 times as fast. I'll admit, this would be under ideal conditions, so in practice it would most likely take more land, probably several times as much. But even if we need 5 or even 10 times as much it would still be far superior to planting trees.

We probably couldn't plant them all at once, it would be more practical to plant bamboo forests every year and cut them down next year to plant new bamboo trees in the same area. We might also use several fast growing bamboo species that can grow in different climates, that way we can spread it out into several forests around the world. The other species won't grow a meter per day, but probably still fast enough.

Of course all this would result in 732 billion tons or 915 billion m³ (32 trillion ft³) of wood, that's 915 km³ (220 mi³) or a cube with a side length of 9.7km (6 miles). That's way more then the entire world could ever use, and we'd have to find ways to permanently store that somewhere. We could roast it to charcoal and press it to get 293 billion tons of coal which would reduce the volume to one sixth, which might be challenging to do at this scale.

Anyway, if you have any criticisms I'd love to know. I know this solution sounds crazy, but I think at this point we have to seriously consider solutions like that, I see no way we could make it otherwise at this point. I think we have to spread the idea of planting bamboo instead of trees, since it could actually be a realistic solution and not just virtue signaling.",1629917311.0,0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/pbhmja/planting_trees_is_pointless_but_i_might_have_a/,cutting down forests,Positive

1gwr6ta,"Of the 1500 climate policies announced world wide, only 63 would reduce emissions","Editor’s summary From Science.org

“It is easy for countries to say they will reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, but these statements do not mean that the policies they adopt will be effective. Stechemesser et al. evaluated 1500 climate policies that have been implemented over the past 25 years and identified the 63 most successful ones. Some of those successes involved rarely studied policies and unappreciated combinations. This work illustrates the kinds of policy efforts that are needed to close the emissions gaps in various economic sectors. “—Jesse Smith

Abstract

Meeting the Paris Agreement’s climate targets necessitates better knowledge about which climate policies work in reducing emissions at the necessary scale. We provide a global, systematic ex post evaluation to identify policy combinations that have led to large emission reductions out of 1500 climate policies implemented between 1998 and 2022 across 41 countries from six continents. Our approach integrates a comprehensive climate policy database with a machine learning–based extension of the common difference-in-differences approach. We identified 63 successful policy interventions with total emission reductions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tonnes CO2. Our insights on effective but rarely studied policy combinations highlight the important role of price-based instruments in well-designed policy mixes and the policy efforts necessary for closing the emissions gap.”

efuku5,How could a few degrees of global warming harm?,"2 ℃ - 
mountain glaciers and rivers will start to disappear and mountainous regions will see more landslides, as the permafrost that held them together melts away.

Sea levels could rise by a metre, displacing 10% of the world's population. Countries such as the Maldives will be submerged and the Indian subcontinent will be left fighting for survival. People will also die in greater numbers as they struggle with the increasing heat.

The ecosystem will collapse and a third of all life on earth will face extinction. Plant growth will slow, then stop. Plants don't absorb carbon dioxide very well so begin to emit it - making global warming worse.

The world's food centres will become barren and one third of the planet will be without fresh water.

3 ℃ - 
up to 40% of the Amazon rainforest will be destroyed and warmer soil will kill vegetation and release more carbon.

Hurricanes will be stronger and cities in Asia, Australia and the south-east of the US will face destruction. Holland will be torn apart by the North Sea.

Saltwater will creep upstream, poisoning the groundwater and ruining the food supply.

4 ℃ - 
millions of people will begin to flee coastal areas, cities will begin to vanish and some will become islands.

The ice at both poles will vanish over time and this could see a rise in sea levels of as much as 50m, although this may take hundreds or thousands of years.

China, a major producer of the world's rice, wheat and maize, could see its agriculture fail - it will need to feed more than a billion people on two-thirds of its current harvest.

Summers will be longer and soaring temperatures will see forests turn to firewood, with even Britain's south reaching 45 ℃. The increased demand on air-conditioning puts massive pressure on the country's power grid.

5 ℃ higher in the oceans - 
frozen methane hydrate from the seabeds will gasify and ascend to the atmosphere. 
Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and may cause an extra temperature rise of 4-5 ℃ over time. 

6 ℃ - 
rainforests will be deserts and massive numbers of migrants will flock to the few parts of the world they see as inhabitable, resulting in racial conflict and civil war.

Many will choose places such as Canada and Siberia but even those climates may be too hot to grow food.

Stagnant oceans mean more hydrogen sulphide, which kills the sea-life and, if the sea heats up enough, massive stores of methane hydrate under the sea will begin to escape.

Methane is flammable and the smallest spark or lightning strike could see fireballs tearing across the sky.

18y4jh6,"No, Peter D Carter, radiative forcing is NOT above the worst-case scenario (RCP 8.5).","Recently, I noticed a remarkable post which shared [this tweet](https://x.com/PCarterClimate/status/1740968819030700399?s=20) from Peter D Carter including an eye-catching figure (shown below). The post did not appear to attract significant attention (except for my own), and I will not link to it, because my concern lies entirely with rebutting Carter's original claim (please don't shoot the messenger). Take a look at the post and see if you can spot the issue.

https://preview.redd.it/ri6lztf9mdac1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f8ddd2f7a44560b8bd3970cc532ce9d073c636b

If you haven't found it, I wouldn't blame you, the mistake isn't obvious, and I would like to think that Peter D Carter is also ignorant of it, rather than choosing to intentionally spread misinformation. The claim is very simple, that the radiative forcing in 2022 is above the ""worst-case scenario"" i.e. the RCP 8.5 scenario. To justify his claim, he haphazardly has arranged three plots. At first glance, his three plots look convincing enough. On the right, radiative forcing in 2022 is \~3.4, and on the left, that value is above all of the RCPs in 2022. So what's the problem?

The problem is that **the graphs are plotting different things**. The two on the left are plotting **total radiative forcing,** while the plot on the right is plotting **only the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases**.

The left-most graph is Fig 10. from van Vuuren et al. (2011), it depicts **total** radiative forcing, from that paper,

>The combination of trends in greenhouse gases and those in atmospheric pollutants translate to changes in concentrations affecting the overall development of radiative forcing. As shown in Fig. 10, the RCPs, as specified in the original selection criteria, cover the trends and level of radiative forcing values of scenarios in the literature very well. **Total radiative forcing is determined by both positive forcing from greenhouse gases and negative forcing from aerosols.**

That is to say, to make a proper comparison between these three plots, we would need to know the total radiative forcing from both greenhouse gases and aerosols in 2022. Carter provides us with an [accurate and reliable estimate](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/ghgpower/) of the radiative forcing from GHGs in 2022 of roughly \~3.4 Wm^(-2). Unfortunately, estimates of negative forcing from aerosols vary widely, and I was unable to find any scientific paper which attempted to estimate global instantaneous radiative forcing from aerosols in specifically the year 2022, however we have relatively recent estimates from the AR6 IPCC report for the year 2019. Total aerosol forcing is a combination of aerosol-radiation (IRFari) and aerosol-cloud (IRFaci) interactions (see AR6 WGI 7.3.3), according to the AR6 report, in 2019,

>IRFari is assessed to be –0.25 ± 0.2 W m–2 . . .  
>  
>IRFaci is assessed to be –0.7 ± 0.5 W m–2 . . .

Thus, the total IRF from aerosols is \~-0.95 ± 0.7 Wm^(-2). So, in 2022, roughly speaking, total RF was \~3.4 - 0.95 = 2.45 Wm^(-2) ± 0.7. This is roughly the figure we should actually compare to Fig. 10. Here is what that looks like,

https://preview.redd.it/4cugh6samdac1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d2804b57361508bb51e823e74d5628f4d06ad1d

The dots correspond to the central estimate (\~2.45 Wm-2) and the bounds of uncertainty (\~1.75 and 3.15 Wm^(-2) respectively). As you can see, the central estimate is actually lower than all of the RCPs, and all of the RCPs lie within the bounds of uncertainty.

In conclusion, Peter D Carter's naive comparison of the total radiative forcing projected by the RCPs, and an estimate of just the radiative forcing of GHGs is faulty, and perhaps speaks to his complete lack of understanding of what forcing even is. A better (yet still imperfect) comparison which includes the (albeit uncertain) negative forcing from aerosols shows that all of the RCPs lie within the bounds of uncertainty. Please, please, please don't take twitter ""experts"" (or reddit ""experts"" for that matter) at their word uncritically.

A quick note, in Carter's figures, we are plotting instantaneous radiative forcing, IRF or just RF, and not effective radiative forcing, ERF. The AR6 report has moved on to predominately use ERF. If you would like to check my work (please do), be careful not to mix them up.

Edit: There is another method to compare apples to apples, and that would be to calculate the GHG only forcing in the RCPs in 2022 using the same methodology as Carter's source. I have done so, and provided a table below:

|Data Source|GHG Only Forcing (Wm-2)|
|:-|:-|
|Tans et al. (2023)|3.4035|
|RCP 2.6|3.26|
|RCP 4.5|3.30|
|RCP 6.0|3.26|
|RCP 8.5|3.47|

As you can see his actual cited figure falls between RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Interesting note, notice that both RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 are equal, this is despite the fact that RCP 6.0 ultimately results in significantly more emissions by 2100 than RCP 2.6. By 2022, none of the RCPs have significantly diverged in their emissions (compared to say, in 2050 or 2100). This is another reason why it would be naive to use a single year such as 2022 to say what track we're on.",1704343528.0,49,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/18y4jh6/no_peter_d_carter_radiative_forcing_is_not_above/,greenhouse gases,Positive

1gaa35i,Can we push for a global moratorium on new greenhouse gas emitting power plants?,"Basically, IMO the construction of new plants that burn fossil fuels (or wood pellets) should be banned.

New wood pellet plants should be banned as well, since their designation as ""bio renewable"" has been abused and exploited to tear down forests (including old growths), and turn them into wood pellets.

You only need some number of wealthy countries to enact a ban like this, for it to be effective. Wealthy countries could then bully the rest of the world to comply with such a moratorium through the threat of sanctions, or a heavy carbon price or tariffs on the greenhouse gases emitted by non-compliant countries This could be a global treaty that is activated as soon as 2 countries ratify it, and that is open for any country to join.

msegq2,Hello all! I wanted to ask for the opinion of this group regarding a series of questions/statements for a school assignment. I look forward to responses/opinions and discussion in the comments :)," 

* If Earth has been warmer in the past, what is the issue now?

The Earth has been in and out of icehouse/greenhouse periods throughout its time. Typically, after an ice age has ended it can take the planet about 5,000 years to warm between 4 and 7 degrees Celsius. This is a very slow increase, which is part of why our current situation is concerning. We exited the last glacial period 20,000 years ago, and have since been in a warm interglacial period. During the last century, there has been a warming of a little over 1 degree Fahrenheit. This is 8 times faster than the average ice-age recovery time, and the last 5 years have been the warmest years in centuries.

* What are the causes for the temperature increasing?

A large cause of the temperature increase is the increased output of CO2. Greenhouse gases are necessary in order to keep our planet warm enough for life to exist, too much can cause the planet to become warmer than what we can withstand.

* How do we know that this is from human impact?

We know that the temperature increase is from human impact because we have been able to pin the start of temperature changes starting at the industrial revolution. Volcanoes and El Nino have been looked at and considered as potential contributors, but their effects do not carry long-term changes to the planet to account for the rapid warming.

* How do we know that the Earth has been warmer/colder in the past?

Scientists have been able to determine what the climate was like in the past by studying ice cores from deep below the surface in Antarctica and sediment cores from the bottom of lakes or oceans. These cores can give information as to what the Earth's climate was like hundreds to millions of years ago. They tell us about the amount of CO2 in the air, and if events such as large volcanic eruptions occurred.

* What is the problem with the temperature increasing?

Climate changes (even natural ones) are disruptive to the planet. Climate changes in the past have led to mass extinctions of species, changed the circulation of the ocean, and changed how animals migrate. This impacts us today because humans and animals cannot adapt quickly enough to this rapid increase in temperature.

* What about Texas? One of the warmest states just froze over. How can that mean warming?

Texas had its sudden blast of cold air due to warming temperatures. The air that is above the Arctic had warmed suddenly, which resulted in a weakening of the polar vortex. This caused the cold air to come down, and cause Texas to basically freeze over. Other weather changes can occur, such as more frequent and intense hurricanes due to warmer waters and an increase in wildfires due to droughts.

What do you think?

Do you think that we are causing an impact on the warming of the planet? If not, why do you think that? If you agree, what do you think we can do to help try to reverse the warming of our planet?",1618613193.0,27,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/msegq2/hello_all_i_wanted_to_ask_for_the_opinion_of_this/,greenhouse gases,Positive

mvo9kk,Carbon tax as one of the main tools to fight climate change,"I have been reading a lot on climate change lately and one of the most important things I see governments can do is across the world is to put a price on carbon. 
For example, manufacturing(cement, steel, Aluminum etc) accounts for 31% of total greenhouse gases emissions. Simple subsidies of renewables is not going to make it because it does not give any incentive to industries(cement, steel etc) to switch(or even explore) other alternative approaches instead of coal. I came across this really nice community(https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) which actually lobbies for carbon pricing in the US. However, are there any such other communities that we should look into to lobby the government to put a price on carbon. At an individual level, I think the biggest contribution we can make is to let the leaders know this is important issue and show them we do support carbon tax",1619035802.0,26,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/mvo9kk/carbon_tax_as_one_of_the_main_tools_to_fight/,greenhouse gases,Positive

e20jsh,The world is NOT on pace for 4 degree Celsius warming by 2100.,"A [recent submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e1v8f6/world_on_pace_for_4_degree_celsius_warming_by_2100/) made the claim that the world is on pace for 4 degree Celsius warming by 2100. That's false. Let's look at the basics of climate science, as per the IPCC's AR5.

- CO2 is a greenhouse gas, meaning that increasing the amount in the atmosphere will increase global temperatures, all else being equal.

- It is one of several greenhouse gases. The one that accounts for most of the greenhouse effect is water vapor. That's important to know, for a reason that we'll come back to later.

- The direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2 is an increase in temperature of about 1.1°C, but that doesn't include feedbacks.

- There are positive and negative feedbacks. A positive feedback is one that amplifies a given change in temperature and a negative feedback is one that dampens the change. There are thousands of feedbacks in the climate system.

- When feedbacks are factored in, the resulting temperature change is referred to as ""climate sensitivity."" There are two kinds of climate sensitivity discussed in AR5, the IPCC's fifth and most recent assessment report: ECS and TCR.

- ECS stands for equilibrium climate sensitivity. This is the amount of warming per doubling of CO2 that you get once all the feedbacks have had time to settle in. It's important to note that it takes decades or even centuries to reach equilibrium once a doubling is reached.

- TCR stands for transient climate response. This is the amount of warming expected while CO2 is rising and at the time that a doubling is reached.

- Preindustrial CO2 was about 280 parts per million (ppm), so a doubling would be 560 ppm.

- Present CO2 levels are about 400 ppm.

- Future CO2 concentrations will depend on lots of things like population growth, CO2 emissions per capita, natural carbon sinks, etc. (My own best guess is that we won't reach 560 ppm until near the end of the century, maybe 2080-2090.)

- Producing a value for either type of climate sensitivity is really, really hard. AR5 listed the likely range as 1.5-4.5°C per doubling. That's the same range as was first proposed in the 70s or 80s. It's been really difficult to narrow it down because the climate system is chaotic and extremely complex. 

- One significant paper that didn't meet the cutoff for AR5 was Otto, et al 2013. It suggested that ECS is on the low end of AR5's range.

- As far as most of us are concerned, TCR is the most relevant measure of climate sensitivity because we don't have to wait for feedbacks to shake out like with ECS. 

- AR5's estimate for TCR was 1.8°C per doubling.

- The uncertainty around TCR is much smaller, meaning narrower error bars.

- One paper after AR5 had TCR as low as 1.33°C per doubling.

- The Earth has warmed about 0.8-0.9°C since ~1910. A portion of that warming was natural, the rest attributable to mankind. 

Putting all of this together, there's just no way we get to 4°C by 2100 using mainstream science.",1574786651.0,20,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e20jsh/the_world_is_not_on_pace_for_4_degree_celsius/,greenhouse gases,Positive

fme004,Can we see how close we are from the tipping point?,"I'm not sure it's correct but from what I've understood, regarding the greenhouse gases, the tipping point will be when the ""natural"" sources get over the ""natural"" sinks...

At the moment if I emit, let's say, 10Gt of CO2, only (completely invented numbers) 5Gt will stay in the atmosphere because the ecosystems, the ocean... capture a large part of it. But, when the tipping point is crossed, does that mean that, due to the destruction of natural ecosystems and other positive feedback loops, when I produce 10Gt of CO2, then let's say 12Gt end up in the air because my 10Gt have triggered some loops that have released even more (like the melting of the Permafrost)...

So, the way I've understood it is that, when the tipping point is crossed, the Earth, instead of pumping CO2 (and thus reducing the Global Heating), switch around and now produces more CO2 (or methane) than it captures... Is that correct?

If it is, can we already see it happening? By comparing the CO2 we emit and the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere for example? (something like +x ppm CO2/Gt CO2 emitted in the 80s and +y ppm CO2/Gt CO2 emitted in the 2010s... and then y should be higher that x)",1584792445.0,17,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/fme004/can_we_see_how_close_we_are_from_the_tipping_point/,greenhouse gases,Positive

wjqs5q,Questions about carbon (and other greenhouse gas) capture,"To get the obvious out of the way, the only way to make such capture make sense is to reduce emissions. However, beyond that there are a few questions which I wish to ask (I’ve already read up on some of these but I was looking for more input):

1: Why such a focus on Capturing carbon from the air (excluding niche applications where direct air capture is actually feasible)? Does it not make more sense to capture CO2 from the ocean where it would be much more concentrated; then after such capture occurs the CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and oceans occur and more CO2 ends up in the ocean which can then be captured (reducing both atmospheric and ocean CO2 concentration(s))?

2. How effective would microorganisms (either naturally occurring or gm’ed) be in cc? For example using a genetically modified or naturally occurring organism which utilizes bio-mineralization to help create something like calcium carbonate from Ocean Water? Or perhaps using similar organisms to effectively grow concrete/limestone blocks (not sure how possible this is, just spitballing), thereby saving two birds with one seed so to speak by dealing with a significant portion of construction emissions and also sequestering carbon? Microorganisms seem to have tons of untapped potential, especially for helping clean up our various pollution problems.

3. How would the capture of CO2 effect temperature. For example, say we reduced CO2 in the atmosphere to around/below 350 ppm somehow, what would happen? What if this was combined with other geo-engineering tactics like using earth surface based mirrors to increase albedo to help prevent short term warming?

4. What about capture of other greenhouse gases. Obviously CO2 is very important, but say we slay that dragon, how do we capture and store the others?

cgft25,"Implications of paper: ""Strengthening tropical Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient consistent with rising greenhouse gases""","A recent paper in Nature ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0505-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0505-x)) indicates that current state of the art climate models may need to be updated. Quote: "" The failure of state-of-the-art models to capture the correct response introduces critical error into their projections of climate change in the many regions sensitive to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures."" I'm wondering to what extent current models may indeed need to be updated and to what extent the updated models are likely to predict relatively less mean global warming by 2100? The last sentence suggests ""continuing La Nina-like trends"" which might imply somewhat lower warming though still extreme weather volatility (more droughts in one region, more rainfall in another)? Quote: ""However, the strength of the tropical Pacific influence on global climate implies that past and future trends will diverge from those simulated by coupled climate models that, due to their cold tongue bias, misrepresent the response of the tropical Pacific to rising CO2. Until state-of-the-art models more faithfully represent the observed tropical Pacific, climate impact assessments should consider the consequences for the global hydroclimate of continuing La Niña-like trends in tropical Pacific SSTs""

132i7e4,Earth's Energy Budget diagram with GHE quantified and energy flows that don't transfer heat shown,"&#x200B;

Above is a greatly re-worked version of the diagram. (Same content, different presentation.) The previous version is below. (If image doesn't appear above, see [https://climatepuzzles.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EarthsEnergyBudgetAndGHE5-scaled.jpg](https://climatepuzzles.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EarthsEnergyBudgetAndGHE5-scaled.jpg).)

I'm hoping the above diagram which I recently generated and posted to the [Wikipedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Earth_Energy_Budget_with_GHE.svg) will be useful in clarifying some things about how the Greenhouse Effect (GHE) functions.

I spend a lot of time talking to people who don't believe in the Greenhouse effect. I find that there seem to be some widespread problems with the way the GHE is often talked about that get in the way of any chance of people properly understanding how the GHE functions. This version of an ""Earth's Energy Budget"" diagram aims to help improve the way that the GHE is talked about.

One issue that people often get hung up on is the issue of ""back-radiation"" transferring energy from the atmosphere to the surface. There is often a concern that this somehow violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The problem, of course, is that folks are failing to distinguish energy flows from thermodynamic heat transfer.

To try to help clarify matters, the new diagram differentiates radiation energy flows which do not constitute ""heat transfer"" from those that do.

Note: I think people make this problem worse when they talk about downwelling longwave radiation (or ""back radiation"") ""warming"" the surface. Many people are certain this can only mean that ""heat"" is being transferred from the cold atmosphere to the warm surface. As the diagram tries to clarify, what is happening is actually a reduction in surface cooling, i.e., a reduction in radiation heat transfer away from the surface. This ultimately leads to the surface being warmer, but it's an indirect effect rather than a direct one. Failing to acknowledge the indirectness of this result leads to no end of trouble in the conversations I get into with climate skeptics.

The other thing the diagram does is try to focus more attention on energy balance at the top of the atmosphere, instead of focusing so much on what happens at the surface. What happens at the surface is, ultimately, quite complicated. The logic  of the GHE is simpler and more compelling when one focuses on energy balance at the top of the atmosphere.

Climate scientists typically quantitatively define the GHE as the difference between the amount of thermal radiation that leaves the surface and the amount of thermal radiation that reaches space. (It's unfortunately how relatively unknown this definition seems to be. See IPCC AR6 WG1 p. 968 for the place where I found the initial clues concerning this quantitative definition.)  The diagram illustrates this quantitative definition of the GHE.

People may initially be baffled as to why this way of defining the GHE makes sense. However, thinking about that can ultimately be quite productive, unlike what happens when one pursues some other narratives about the GHE.

As an example of those unproductive narratives... While it's not really addressed in the diagram, it's also problematic when people talk about greenhouse gases in the air absorbing thermal radiation, thereby ""warming"" the air. This is problematic because:

1. Speaking this way tends to lead many climate skeptics down a rabbit hole of trying to deny that this could possibly be true. Their reasoning is always full of misunderstandings (in my experience). But, there is nothing productive about such conversations.
2. It plays into a false narrative that the GHE functions through infrared radiation warming the air--which it doesn't. In fact, for most greenhouse gasses at most elevations, more infrared thermal radiation is emitted than is absorbed. So, the net effect of greenhouse gasses is almost always to cool the air.

So, talking about the air being warmed through greenhouse gases absorbing longwave radiation generates confusion and resistance, and isn't even true, on balance.

Anyway, I'm hoping some people might find this new diagram to be of value.

txlblg,Is this even feasible?,"  

The new IPCC report states the following:

1. Emissions need to drop 43% by 2030 to stop the rise in temperature to 1.5C.

2. Emissions need to drop 84% by 2050 to stop the rise in temperature to 1.5C.

3. Greenhouse gases must stop rising by 2025, just 3 years away, to have hope of staying less than 2C of warming. 

They also warn that temperature rise above 1.5C risk the collapse of ecosystems and triggering of irreversible shifts in the climate system.

Given the large amount of greenhouse gases that are released are accelerating the change of the climate, but isn’t this something that would inevitably happen eventually as we are we technically still in an ice age and the earth should be on a cycle leaning more towards warming (may be mistaken here)?

Rising and falling sea levels over the course of the earth’s life cycle is also something that we would inevitably have to deal with one day even if the release of green house gasses were drastically decreased, is it not? As well as certain bodies of water eventually drying up and areas having less or more rainfall. 

It is understood that we are speeding up global warming, but is this not a cycle of earth that would eventually happen one day no matter if we were here or not?

So, i am doing a presentation on greenhouse gases, how they work etc. I find the fact that water vapour is classified as a greenhouse gas a bit confusing. The definition of greenhouse gas im working with is a gas that contributes to heating the planet (greenhouse effect) by absorbing infrared radiation. I get how water vapour does this, but here in [this article](https://climate.nasa.gov/ask-nasa-climate/3143/steamy-relationships-how-atmospheric-water-vapor-amplifies-earths-greenhouse-effect/), it says that water vapour isnt causing it, but amplifying it. This confuses me a bit, since it sounds like the same mechanism - it absorbs infrared radiation, like CO2 or methane. So, could someone help me see the flaw in my thinking, and help explain why water vapour is a greenhouse gas, and why its amplifying rather than causing the greenhouse effect?

vohv8w,A climate thought experiment.,"For the sake of a thought experiment, let's all assume that the science of climate change (e.g., climatology) is generally correct. So, even if you don't believe that yourself, just temporary assume it (e.g., imagine or ""suspend belief"" ) for the sake of this thought experiment. In other words, this post is more of a philosophical discussion within the context of what we can do to mitigate the increase in average global heating (that causes climate change), assuming the science is generally correct. So, even if you consider yourself a climate sceptic (or you know someone that does), you do have the imagination to ""make-believe"" the alternative view.

In our little thought experiment, billions of people are not aware of the science. Maybe they are misinformed about that science or are motivated due to monetary or lifestyle reasons (e.g., business), to believe in an alternative view. And disinform others about that science (e.g., greenwash).

Therefore, logically we can deduce that these billions of people will not be motivated to not do something that they do not consider a problem. In other words, they will not be motivated to not burn Carbon-based fuels even if they could (e.g., of carbon-based fuels: coal \[""fossil"" fuel\], gas, and crude oil derivatives such as diesel and petrol (& biofuels. e.g., wood or oils derived from other types of plants). In fact, proximately, billions of people perceive that burning these fuels (i.e., to fuel their machines), is a solution (e.g., to travel or ""get the job done"").

So, we have established in this thought experiment two concepts.

1. That many people are not sufficiently aware of the relevant science (e.g., due to ignorance, being greenwashed or biased)
2. That many people will continue to be sold, buy and burn (or use machines that burn) carbon-based fuels.

Also, in our thought experiment, we have assumed that the relevant science is generally correct. For example, the general narrative is that some people in our societies say that the science says climate change is real and some people say it's not. Those that say it's real also say that its greenhouse gas emissions (& land degradation. e.g., deforestation) that are causing the biosphere (air, water and land) to heat up (On average. i.e.,  ""overall"". And it's that extra heat that is causing the climate to change).

The purpose of this thought experiment is not to debate who is right or wrong, it's to assume, for the sake of a thought experiment, that burning carbon-based fuels (Carbon dioxide and Methane emissions) and animal agriculture (Methane and Carbon dioxide emissions) are the leading cause of greenhouse gas emission which are heating up the Planet's biosphere (& ocean acidification within the context of Carbon Dioxide).

Therefore,

3. The Planet's biosphere is going to continue to heat up (on average). And heat drives the Planet's weather systems (amongst other variables such as water). Which over time is termed ""human-caused climate change"" (in contrast to non-human caused climate change. e.g., solar radiation from the sun)

So,  there are no signs that humans are going to stop burning more carbon-based fuels any time soon. For example,  Carbon dioxide targets keep getting ""missed"". Greenhouse gas emissions increase rather than decrease. Politicians and industries keep signing on the ""extract more oil"" contracts or ""dig up more coal"" contracts or have more agricultural animals ""burping methane"" contracts.

So, there are no limits in our economic system that is preventing humanity from continuously heating up the planet's biosphere. And, as already discussed, the system is actually designed to encourage humans to burn more fuels, not less.

The next logical question is ""is increasingly heating up the Planet's biosphere bad?"".

Will it be ""bad"" if the ice (snow, etc) melts in the polar regions? Will that be ""bad"" for those billions of people that live near the coast (the sea)?  will it be ""bad"" for those billions of people (and non-human animals, plants and fungi), that live in regions close to the equator? (i.e., countries where it can already get very hot at certain times of the year)

Or will climate heating have some good effects? Maybe it will prevent the coming of the next (big) ice age? Maybe a little bit of climate heating isn't all ""bad"" news? But maybe too much will tip our civilisations over the ""edge"".

However, the established science (that we are assuming is correct), generally says that climate heating is a ""bad"" idea (not that we explicitly planned it. i.e., greenhouse gases are a byproduct of the activities we do. e.g., some like the ""meat"", and are not thinking about the methane emissions that the agricultural animals produce).

Therefore, assuming that human-caused climate heating is a ""bad"" idea, the next logical question is can we choose to prevent it? And if so, what is causing us to not prevent it? Is it impossible to not eat farmed meat? Is it impossible to not turn forests into wood fuel tree plantations?

Or is it simply impossible for many humans to actually want to really do something themselves to prevent climate heating?

Please keep all replies within the scope of this thought experiment. So that, for example, we are not denying that billions of humans burning fuels is causing climate heating.",1656620418.0,8,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/vohv8w/a_climate_thought_experiment/,greenhouse gases,Negative
1eahfmc,Methane vs CO2 -- a question.,"Methane traps more much heat than CO2; it is a much more potent greenhouse gas (GHG). But methane stays in the atmosphere much less time than CO2 does. From what I have read, methane that is released now will stay around 12 years in the atmosphere. By contrast, CO2 released now will last for much longer, namely, at least hundreds of years.

How should we weigh these different variables (namely, potency vs longevity) against each other, to get some sense of how harmful each gas overall is in terms of warming?

**For instance, suppose we could wave a magic wand and either remove 1 ton of CO2 or remove 1 ton of methane from the atmosphere. Which gas should we choose?**

If we remove methane, then we are removing the stronger GHG. That seems good! On the other hand, we are removing just 12 years worth of warming. If we remove CO2, however, we are removing hundreds of years of warming. That seems good too!

Is there a ""lifetime warming"" quantity that can be calculated for each of these tons, i.e. for CO2 and for methane? If so, then we could say, ""Let's remove the ton with the lower lifetime warming quantity."" Has this calculation been done? If so, which gas has the lower lifetime warming quantity?

(Of course, if we as a planet are near some or other tipping point within a decade or so, then it could make sense to remove the methane even if it has a lower lifetime warming effect. It could make sense to do tha tin order to prevent methane's potency -- albeit its shorter-term potency -- from pushing us over some threshold and into a harmful tipping point scenario. My guess is that that consideration might be decisive in favor of removing the 1 ton of methane instead of the 1 ton of CO2.)

*Side note 1:* I see various estimates for the longevity of atmospheric CO2. E.g. NASA says 300 to 1000 years. Other sites just say ""hundreds to thousands of years."" Why so imprecise? Do we not know CO2's longevity in the atmosphere? Or is it complicated by other factors/complexities, so that ""It depends"" is the only fair answer?

*Side note 2:* Of course, the same question (""Remove this or CO2?"") could be asked of nitrous oxide, not just methane. From what I have read, though, nitrous oxide is apparently much more potent than CO2 AND quite long-lived as well (unlike methane). So it seems an easier question, whether to remove 1 ton of CO2 or 1 ton of nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, I assume! Even more so with fluorinated gases vs CO2. Hence, my focus in this post on methane in particular.",1721764758.0,9,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1eahfmc/methane_vs_co2_a_question/,greenhouse gases,Positive

My eyeball average is as much blue/violet (cooler than baseline) regions as orange/red (hotter).  Since the energy goes into increasing the planet's average temperature, one would expect more orange.  These are air temperatures, so perhaps the energy is hiding in the oceans.

Click ""SST Anomaly"" to view sea surface temperatures.  They do show much more red than blue.  Of course, the oceans are deep, so would need data on the temperatures at all depths to estimate the planet's total energy storage.

Another factor is that the earth is still generating heat from radioactive decay within, which is conducted to the surface.

Global warming is almost definitely going to happen, and even the naysayers must agree that any work done to prevent climate change could only lead to a healthier planet in the long run. Yet many people choose to ignore al the evidence piling up, such as rising temperatures, sea levels, increased numbers of extreme weather events, and the fact that all these seem to coincide with the massive amounts of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere every year.

In short, they’re saying that the Milankovitch cycle will “balance it out,” so there will be no warming caused by human activity. They also said that if there is a warming, it will “ONLY” be caused by the cycle. For context, this was from two classmates in my “natural disasters” course.

But… don’t human activities already speed up the warming process?? And greenhouse gases and Co2 ALONE have also been proven to be harmful in multiple ways, not just in warming the climate, so shouldn’t we lower the emissions, anyway?

i0kpc7,Is there some factor in which greenhouse gasses are absorbed in a certain time?,"Hi all,

This is my first post on reddit so please excuse me in the case I'm breaking some (unwritten) rules here.

Anyhow, I am currently writing a bachelor's thesis in the field of microeconomics and my topic is about how taxation can cause dairy producers to adjust their level of milk production, or decide to migrate to another country. The idea is, that there could be a level of taxation where dairy farmers decide to migrate to countries where production is cheaper, causing higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. In other words - can taxes (that could be aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions) have a negative net-effect in overall global emissions?

The problem is, my knowledge about environmental chemistry is quite minimal and my thesis supervisor asks me to find a level of taxation where *the accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions is stable*, in other words, the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted in a year equals the amount of gasses that are absorbed/broken down in that same year.

In other words, my supervisor asks me to describe a function like:  
S(t+1) = S(t) (1-x) + E(t+1)  
where S is the level of gases in the air, and E is the emissions in that period (I have an emission function) and x is the proportion of gases that disappear. 

As it is in the context of dairy farms, for simplicity's sake, I consider carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions. For those gasses I can find a '[atmospheric lifetime](https://www.seattle.gov/light/news/RFI_RFP/RFP_ggm_Appendix1.pdf)' which is a number of years in which gasses are expected to remain inside the atmosphere. Does that mean for any gas, I can assume that there is some type of exponential decay (regardless of the quantity of emissions)?

Does anybody know if there is a certain percentage rate of decay for those gasses?

1ex7ata,Roles of Earth’s Albedo Variations and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in Recent Warming: New Insights from Satellite and Surface Observations,"Analogous to the famous “follow-the-money” approach often adopted by the social and political sciences to explain human behavior and social movements, this study can be described as a “follow-the-energy” journey to investigate the causes of recent climate warming.

These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the current paradigm of understanding about climate change and related socio-economic initiatives aimed at drastic reductions of industrial carbon emissions at all costs. An important aspect of this paradigm shift should be the prioritized allocation of funds to support large-scale interdisciplinary research into the physical mechanisms controlling the Earth’s albedo and cloud physics, for these are the real drivers of climate on multidecadal time scales.

The IPCC AR6 Working Group I (WG1) concluded that well-mixed greenhouse gases were “very likely the main driver of tropospheric warming since 1979” [1]. However, Chapter 7 of the IPCC AR6 WG1 Contribution did not take into proper consideration the observed increase of solar radiation absorption by Earth in recent decades known as “global brightening” [2] (Section 7.2.2.3). The Report did not analyze the decrease of Earth’s shortwave reflectance evident in the CERES EBAF dataset over the past 20 years and its impact on GSAT. Published studies agree that the observed decrease of planetary albedo and the associated increase of solar-energy uptake by the planet must have had a significant impact on the global temperature. However, there has been no attempts thus far to quantify the actual effect of this solar forcing on GSAT. We tried to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a novel, non-statistical process model from First Principles that explicitly relates changes in TSI and albedo to global temperature anomalies. The model (Equation (16)) was derived from independent NASA planetary observations and basic rules of calculus without using Earth-specific data, greenhouse-gas radiative forcing, or positive (amplifying) feedbacks. Our goal was to verify the above IPCC AR6 conclusion by assessing the direct effect of measured changes in TSI and Earth’s sunlight absorption on the 21st-century global surface warming as documented by 6 temperature datasets.

Our analysis revealed that the solar forcing (i.e., TSI and albedo changes) measured by CERES explain 100% of the observed global warming trend and 83% of the interannual GSAT variability over the past 24 years (Figure 9), including the extreme 2023 heat anomaly (Figure 10). Albedo changes were found to be by far the dominant GSAT driver, while TSI variations only played a minor, modulating role (Figure 11 and Figure 12). The sustained increase of sunlight absorption by the planet was also identified as the most likely driver of ocean warming in recent decades based on a high correlation (R2 = 0.8) between the shortwave radiation uptake and the mean annual temperature anomaly of the 0–100 m global oceanic layer (Figure 8). These results suggest a lack of physical reality to both the anthropogenic radiative forcing attributed to rising greenhouse gases and the positive (amplifying) feedbacks hypothesized by the greenhouse theory and simulated by climate models. This is because any real forcing (or amplifying feedback) outside of the increased planetary uptake of solar radiation would have produced additional warming above and beyond the amount explained by changes in the planetary albedo and TSI. However, no such extra warming is observed in the available temperature records. Hence, the anthropogenic radiative forcing and associated positive feedbacks are likely model artifacts rather than real phenomena. The empirical data and model calculations analyzed in our study also indicate that the Earth’s climate sensitivity to radiative forcing is only 0.29–0.30 K/(W m−2). Therefore, the greenhouse theory overestimates this parameter by 56–158%.

The lack of evidence for heat trapping by greenhouse gases in the climate system during the 21st Century raises an important question about the physical nature of the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI). The latter is defined as the difference between the absorbed shortwave and outgoing LW flux at the TOA. EEI has been observed and calculated by various monitoring platforms for several decades. This index became a research focus in climate science during the past 15 years, because it has been perceived as evidence of anthropogenic heat accumulation (energy retention) in the Earth system that would commit the World to a prolonged future warming, even after human carbon emissions have reached a net-zero level. As a result of such a view, EEI is now called the “most fundamental indicator for climate change” [33]. However, our analysis of observed data, model calculations, and standard thermodynamic theory showed that EEI has been misinterpreted by the science community, since it arises from adiabatic dissipation of thermal energy in ascending air parcels in the troposphere due to a decreasing atmospheric pressure with height (see discussion in Section 4). Hence, integrating EEI over space and time in an effort to calculate some total “energy gain” by the Earth system, as done by researchers in recent years, is physically misleading, because EEI includes energy that was adiabatically lost to the system during the convective cooling process. Our analyses also showed that this energy imbalance results from a varying sunlight absorption by the planet and would only disappear if the Earth’s albedo stops changing and the uptake of shortwave radiation stabilizes, which is unlikely to ever occur. The reduction of human greenhouse-gas emissions cannot and will not affect EEI. Nevertheless, the Earth has gained a considerable amount of thermal energy over the past 45 years due to a sustained increase of shortwave-radiation uptake, which is a completely different mechanism from the theorized trapping of radiant heat by greenhouse gases, since it does not involve a hidden energy storage.",1724188605.0,5,91,https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7418/4/3/17,greenhouse gases,Positive

wcrfy5,Can Somebody Debunk All of This?,"So, I have this friend who is a degreed meteorologist and he has posted this exact post on Facebook at least a dozen times. Nobody really argues with him and he gets praise for fighting the MSM and the libs. I'm looking for someone to help me tear it apart.  

Here it is...

With more talk of ""climate action"" and ""climate initiatives"" in Washington DC, I wanted to offer a purely scientific perspective of what I believe are the *facts*, facts that the IPCC and many climate scientists conveniently ignore because they would (1) destroy their entire arguments, (2) cause precious research funding to dry up, or (3) do not support the political/ideological agendas that so many of them espouse.   

Hence the name ""climate politicians"" I've assigned to a large cohort of the climate science community.  I would encourage you to read the book ""Unsettled"" by Steven E. Koonin; he provides a very objective foray into the current state of climate science, what is factual and what's not.    

The following basic concepts have been compiled over years through many discussions with experts in multiple fields, and through ample research of my own.  

Here are my thoughts, and the attached calculations I updated just this morning should be intuitive enough:

1.  Water vapor is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas, on average 25-100x more concentrated in the atmosphere than CO2. More importantly, however, is that it is an efficient absorber of infrared (IR) radiation at nearly *all* of the same wavelengths on the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum as CO2.  

Therefore, IR absorption due to water vapor universally overwhelms that due to CO2, greatly reducing CO2's efficiency as a greenhouse gas.  In fact, across the EM spectrum, you could argue that methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, albeit less concentrated.

2.  Suppose no other greenhouse gases existed but CO2, and it was *solely* responsible for the Earth's surface temperature. This is of course a poor assumption, but one that many climate scientists seem to believe and an assumption that has been used to initialize climate models, that CO2 overwhelms every other global climate forcing mechanism, even changes in solar output!  
  
Yet if we go along with their assumption, the attached numbers are reasonable estimates of how the global temperature would change with ever-increasing CO2.  I derived them from a program called MODTRAN using simplified radiative transfer theory.  You can see the logarithmically *diminishing* efficacy of CO2 as a greenhouse gas as concentration increases.  Even if we triple CO2 from its concentration in 1750 and ignore everything else, the global temperature would increase by *at most* 20% from the 1750 baseline, or from 52.6F to 63.4F.

Again, this is ignoring everything else and assuming CO2 is the sole influence on the Earth's surface temperature. Not very impressive when you look at the actual chemistry and physics and how CO2 behaves as a greenhouse gas…

3.  Finally, you have to consider the very concept of a ""global average temperature,"" as this oft-discussed article does from the Journal of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics: http://www.uoguelph.ca/.../res.../globaltemp/globaltemp.html
. 
Their argument, and I agree, is that a global average surface temperature has no physical meaning.  It's a statistic, and one that assumes a non-equilibrium system (the Earth's atmosphere), is in equilibrium.  The arithmetic mean/average of such a system has NO physical meaning because you're essentially averaging apples and oranges!  

Said temperature cannot and should not, therefore, be used as a baseline for measuring climatic changes, and especially making crippling political/economic decisions.

w4kwqz,How do YOU cope with climate anxiety?,"Hello Reddit. 
I am about to be a sophomore in college, studying environmental science. I hope to obtain my PhD in Environmental or Atmospherical Science once I get my bachelors. I am currently working for a tree company as a Plant Health Care Technician. I protest, I vote, I reduce my carbon footprint, I recycle and use as little plastic as possible. 
I think I’m passionate about helping the planet, hence why I want to get my PhD and get into heavy research and solutions for climate change. 
I have so much hope for technology and our current generation to do enough to make a change. I have hope that if we vote properly, our government will actually do something positive and quick revolving around climate change. 
But every day, I feel like my hope dwindles. Every day, it’s a new article just anticipating the end of the world. ‘UK is on fire’ ‘Greenland ice is melting the size of a US state daily’ ‘90% of plankton in the Atlantic has died’ 
It’s something new and horrifying every single day. And it kills me mentally. I hate thinking about living in a dystopian, messed up world. I hate not living a normal, worry free life. I hate thinking that global collapse is imminent and there’s no point to anything anymore. 
I’m defeated and frustrated at climate deniers and a global government that does nothing. 
I don’t want to lose hope. It’s all I’ve got before going insane. If all hope is lost, what else is there? 

How do you, people of Reddit who feel the same way as I do, cope with all of this? How do you accept any of this?

w3jqrl,The questions on climate change that people are struggling to understand,"Uhm. Hi. Haven't posted here in a while.

Some friends and I made a plan. We want to do small comics with accompanying short articles explaining climate change and different things connected to it. 

Now, here is our problem: We are all (apart from the artist) involved into research one way or another. So, we are what we Germans would call ""Fachidioten"" (""science idiots"" I guess). Meaning: We all have a deep understanding of what is happening. What we are lacking is an understanding of the questions normal folks, who do not do research on the topic, have and what topics might need a simple explanation. 

So, I thought I would ask here. What topics do you think should be explained?

 Topics we already have decided on:

* Natural climate change vs man-made climate change
* (Broad) consequences from raising temperatures
* The reason why we have droughts
* The connection between droughts and floodings
* How rising sea temperatures make weather more severe
* What happens if the ocean currents are disrupted
* The importance of glaciers
* How we beat the ozone hole in the 90's
* How the individual carbon footprint was invented to place the blame on normal folks instead of politics

But we are very probably missing things.

So, please. Help us out.

9n4s5k,How Should I Live When Facing Catastrophe?,"I, like many people, read the most recent climate report and kind of freaked out. I spent the evening ranting to my wife that I didn't know what we were supposed to do.

My wife basically told me to stop whining and do something about it. LOL. She's right, of course. But what can I really do?

We can try to conserve energy and waste less food and water. However, the very fact that we live in a house in the suburbs makes us automatically use more resources than others. 

I thought, well maybe I'll sell the house and live in a smaller apartment. But then someone else would be living in the house and using as much, if not more, resources. 

I bought an electric car last year. I needed a new car. My old car had 160,000 miles on it and was strating to cost a fortune in maintenance. So I bought the electric car. I guess it's better than buying an ICE car, but the mere act of buying a new car increased my carbon footprint.

I want to do something. However, I don't want to be the only one making great personal sacrifices. Most won't make the changes necessary on their own. Therefore, one person choosing to live sustainably really won't make much of a difference.

If the whole world is going up in flames anyway, I might as well enjoy the time I have.

The problem is so big that only massive government intervention can solve it. However, that doesn't seem remotely likely in at least the near future.

Do I just cross my fingers and hope for the best? Is voting for the right politicians the answer?

llz8xt,"According to my research nuclear, especially newer next generation reactors which theoretically cannot melt down, is way better for the environment than solar and wind. Why then aren’t any environmental activists promoting nuclear?","I know what you’re going to say so allow me to say it for you. Three Mile Island, Fukushima , CHERNOBYL etc...Thing is there are nuclear power plants which could be built that cannot melt down. Matter of fact when Nuclear power plants were first created we could have developed this safer option but we didn’t for really depressing reasons. 
When we first started developing nuclear reactor technology we had two options. Uranium 235 and Thorium. Thorium had a lot of advantages over Uranium-235. You don’t need to enrich it, just dig it out of the ground and it’s ready to go. Creates way less nuclear waste with a much shorter half life than Uranium 235 and a thorium reactor cannot meltdown. But we went with Uranium 235...Why? Because it was the cold war and you can turn the by products of those sorts of reactors into nuclear weapons a lot easier than you can with Thorium.....

Thing is, we could still develop that technology today. And from what little I’ve read, Thorium reactors would have a lower carbon footprint than any other source of energy that exists. Way better than solar wind. 

Here’s my problem with solar and wind. Everyone I’ve ever met who’s worried about this issue is all gung ho about it. We need to transition to an energy grid made up of solar wind and a shit ton of batteries. But these people never own up to the downsides of such a grid. Things like the duck curve (In short, once the sun goes down, electricity usage goes up and we get a whole bunch of blackous). And more importantly the fact that battery technology is not up to the task at all. No one ever seems to calculate just how much pollution would go into manufacturing all these solar panels wind turbines and batteries. How much toxic waste all these solar panels and batteries will leach into the environment if we don’t setup systems to recycle them (And we most definitely haven’t). 

I’m pretty sure that if we transitioned to this so called “clean energy grid” that all the pollution that goes into making all the stuff necessary will still contribute significantly to climate change. To my mind it’s just less bad than fossil fuels. It’s still bad. I believe that next generation nuclear reactors are by far the cleanest, most sustainable option for power humanity has at it’s disposal and in my mind; the quicker we transition to nuclear rather, the less horrific climate change is going to be. I feel like this drive towards solar and wind is just plain the wrong move. That it is going to doom many more millions if not billions of people to an awfully hungry and thirsty death. That climate change would be far less devastating if we transitioned to next generation nuclear reactors and responsibly devised the systems we need to dispose of the waste properly which humanity totally has the technological no how to do. What we don’t have, is the battery technology needed for a grid based on solar and wind to work.

jj2vkn,Help me calculate the reduction in carbon footprint by turning grass lawns to meadows.,"I’m about to make a proposition to my local community council to convert all public grass lawns to meadows and need some sources that support my claim but I have trouble finding any. 

From what I understand it’s not only the lower need of maintenance that contribute to this but also that meadows capture more CO2 in itself. In order to make an accurate calculation one also need to take the initial preparations into consideration. From my understanding you need to initially scrape off the top grass and soil layer in order to sow the new meadow in less nutrient rich soil. In the most optimal scenario the grass layer is then collected onsite and made to a small hill or something ( in order to reduce further use of heavy machinery). 


So what could the potential carbon footprint reduction be by turning grass lawns into meadows? If you have any information about this It would be much appreciated!

awvtun,What can one person REALLY do?,"But honestly, what can one person really do?  What REAL impact can one single individual make about climate change?

One person making even an extreme change in their lifestyle (such as going from meat-eating to vegan as some suggest) isn't going to make even a minute difference in the big picture. Heck even offing oneself to thus ensure making a no additional carbon footprint in one's future isn't going to make a buy the world a additional millisecond.  Even if the average adult devoted the rest of their lives to fighting climate change (by living the most carbon neutral lifestyle, spending 100% of their spare time planting trees & working with climate change fighting charities) I don't' see where it would make little to no difference.

I truly doubt that a non-average person can make a difference on their own.  Would it even matter if a multi-millionaire spend all of their money buying land & planting trees to offset carbon emissions?  (Seriously, someone do the calculation on this please.)

The only real way to make any effective change is with power & influence.  The bulk of emissions is done by corporations.  So until those stop, climate change will continue.  Industrial emissions would need to be heavily regulated & corporate culture would need to change globally from ""make money first"" to ""go green even if it costs us money & is inconvenient"".  This is highly unlikely to happen, as the world's economy is based on these corporations making money.  Also, even if one major government would regulate its industry, that won't do anything to affect those in other countries (other than to give them an economic advantage).

Technology is the only other answer that I see, but that is dependent in large part on those very industries which need to be regulated.  Also, on having the right person in the right circumstances (i.e., intelligent, educated people funded to do research which probably won't make money) which in large part seems to be luck.

I'm not a climate change expert or economist, or hold any position of power or influence.  I'm just an average person struggling to get by in life (like billions of other people here on this planet), & wishing that I could do something that actually would make a difference.  I'd like to help, but I just don't see anything that I do is going to make any significant difference.  It just seems futile anyway unless those with greater power than me make big changes & I'm not too optimistic about that. So why shouldn't' I just live out the rest of my life the way I've been going & not worry about it?

xqdztj,I made an Android app that makes it easy for you to calculate and track the carbon footprint of your food and find recipes to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions.,"Hello everyone! My name is Nelaven Subaskaran and I am the creator of my app called ""Neunition"".

Neunition is an Android app that makes it easy for you to track the carbon footprint of your food, find recipes with their calculated greenhouse gas emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂-eq), and calculate the emissions for individual ingredients.

I have worked on this app all on my own in my free time for the past year and a half. I've always wanted to build a mobile app for years and I have a passion for environmental issues, so I decided to combine the two things I love and boom Neunition was born.

I know it's a popular reason for people to become vegetarian/vegan because they want to help fight climate change and global warming. A vegetarian/vegan diet is far better for the environment compared to a meat/dairy diet.

I believe seeing the calculated greenhouse gas emissions of what you consume, tracking your emissions, finding environmentally-friendly recipes, and learning which foods are good or bad for the environment can be motivating for someone that is trying to switch to a vegetarian/vegan diet.

There are three core features to the app: Track, Search, and Calculate.

[Track](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/w6gpT0gRT40pHTrZEFe-jTjCxKh1XQSuSZVPhAaUGA-DhFErOq4DVjfsxPrxys2dafXe=w2560-h1440-rw): Users can keep track of the carbon footprint of their food for the current day, current week, current month, and the current year.

[Search](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tQ6ydZ7kd3Ih6uIhnlQ6AeU4ZifIxfo5Oc8fUiKlLlLOrJ7ma07H7FFde0G432JTslw=w2560-h1440-rw)**:** Users can look for recipes with their calculated greenhouse gas emissions. There are three ways to look for recipes: enter a query, enter a query with a selected list of diet/health labels, or click the random button after selecting at least one diet/health label to get various recipes if you are not sure what to look for. You can even add the calculated emissions for a recipe to your carbon footprint records by clicking on the ""+"" button.

[Calculate](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Gnpz_M5D13P-8HdJgsEqE6ACQOeqsiWJfc7LFW7jvUpgBHdVxDUbh6CyoIZzmsYB6wWg=w2560-h1440-rw)**:** Users can manually enter ingredients one at a time to calculate the emissions for each ingredient. This is a great option for those with homemade recipes who would like to see the environmental impact of what they make. If you don't want to enter ingredients one at a time, you can upload an image with a list of ingredients and the app will automatically calculate it for you.

Wondering how we calculate the total amount of GHG emissions for ingredients and recipes? What do the colors mean for all calculated emissions? Check out our FAQ as there is a ton of insightful information to help you learn about the app: [https://neunition.com/#faq](https://neunition.com/#faq)

The app is free to download only on the Google Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.neunition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.neunition)

It would mean the world to me if everyone here could download the app and give it a try. If you're an iOS user please feel free to share the app with your Android friends/family members! I built the Android app and the landing page from scratch and I am the only person maintaining the app. All feedback is welcomed and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments section below.

clkt85,The empress tree and atmospheric carbon removal,"There was an article in Bloomberg today about the empress tree, a fast growing tree with high capacity for carbon trapping.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-02/we-already-have-the-world-s-most-efficient-carbon-capture-technology

Specifically, the article claims this is the most efficient way to scrub atmospheric carbon... and I think that makes sense.

The article claims that an acre of empress trees can trap ~103 tons of carbon in a single year.  Spectacular!  But I wonder how much it would take to balance our global energy usage?

Let’s run the numbers.

Out of laziness, I am approximating our energy consumption as though it came half from gasoline and half from electricity, but I’ll look at both gasoline and electricity independently as well.

A half/half split is generally (if I recall correctly) true for the average American household, but I can post those calculations if someone is interested.  

The numbers for energy carbon footprint come from here: https://carbonfund.org/how-we-calculate/

I used the energy density of gasoline from here:
https://www.ocean.washington.edu/courses/envir215/energynumbers.pdf

Now, I’m using the 2016 global energy load I used in an article I wrote yesterday which was 6.04 x10^17 kJ.

If I use the electrical carbon rate from the above website for the entire load, I get that the total carbon footprint of the world is 42 billion tons... meaning that I need 818 million total acres of Empress trees to balance the load.  That’s 1.278 million square miles, or a geographic square about 1130 miles on each side.

That is rapidly approaching the size of a continent.

Now, if I run the numbers for gasoline, I get that we’re producing 77% more carbon per energy unit... which is much dirtier.

When I put half the loading on gasoline and half on electricity, I come up with a need for a geographic square 1565 miles on each side. 

I do not think we can carbon balance this.


Takeaway:  Converting to electricity from gasoline is good, but we still aren’t sustainable.

Planting some trees can help, but we are eventually going to have to stop burning stuff for energy if we want this level to stop climbing.

I’m not convinced that the carbon loading is the cause of global climate change, especially when the energy numbers alone explain adequately everything that’s been observed.

But I believe pollution is bad and that balancing carbon loading is desirable.

This looks like a pretty big job... I don’t think that a continent sized orchard is going to work.

Initial gut feeling: planting trees is good but we’ve got to convert to lower emission sources before the discussion of balance will even be plausible at current CO2 levels.
...
But this assumes I’m trying to keep CO2 levels where they are (I’d like to, but this isn’t really likely).


Ok, so what’s really going to happen

Well, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere will continue to rise.

Luckily, despite nitrogen absorption limitations causing actual crops to benefit little, CO2 increases in the atmosphere cause plants to absorb more CO2 faster because photosynthesis speeds up.

There is a chart (7.3) In chapter 7 of the document at this link that shows photosynthetic  rate relative to CO2 concentration in soybeans... and shows how fast it increases as CO2 concentration increases.
https://www.nap.edu/read/1911/chapter/8

So let’s assume we are at 400ppm now and will continue to increase because we can’t plant a continent sized copse of empress trees.

Let’s also assume all plants behave the way those soybeans behave.

Now, we have to be able to ballpark actual carbon consumption by plants now to see what % over that quantity we are... this will give us an idea whether plants will be able to compensate for our energy consumption... and at what level our CO2 level will stabilize and if it will.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110928222003.htm

According to this, total carbon capturing of global photosynthesis is about 150 petagrams... or 150 trillion kilograms( 165.3 billion tons).

Ok, so if the total carbon loading of the planetary energy consumption is 42 billion tons, and we assume (very conservatively) none of it is currently represented in the current carbon photosynthetic capturing, I need to increase photosynthetic rate by 25.4% in order to capture all the carbon and stabilize the CO2 concentration.

If you look at fig 7.3 in this document you’ll see a relative comparison of photosynthetic rates at different levels of atmospheric CO2.
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110928222003.htm

I put us currently at 400 ppm, which means our current reference number is 2.2 (1.2 over the baseline of 1).

In order to find the stabilization level, I increase that number by 25.4% to 2.76... which yields a stabilization point at about 1000 ppm if this chart is right (and that’s assumed for no global energy load is currently compensated for by plants... which is wildly conservative).

Now, is this little exercise fraught with uncertainty?  

Yup.

Is the CO2 going to grow without bound... no.  

Is 1000 ppm going to be devastating even if the greenhouse effect is our primary temperature driver?  Probably not.

Assuming stability comes at that point... which is consistent with current observations, that’s not even nearly the highest Earth has seen... while supporting conditions that we believe would be livable.

Here is a chart showing pre-historic CO2 levels.

The reason given was that glass is at least 3 times heavier than plastic, and so there is more weight on the trucks moving the glass product to the grocery store than the plastic product. Thereby giving glass a worse carbon footprint than plastic (presumably even with the plastic incineration taken into account).

Now if the trucks were electric and the power came from renewable energy, then this is mute and glass is a better option. But as that is not the case yet, which packaging would be a more sustainable choice for me the consumer?",1714068023.0,6,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ccxt5m/buying_glass_or_plastic/,carbon footprint,Positive
3vpkxm,"I do my part to try and minimize my carbon footprint, but I do not think it matters.","1. ""The Earth"" will be ""just fine.""  If we screw up and can't grow food, or process water for drinking, etc, the Earth /will/ continue on without us.  Life /will/ adapt.  We, humans, are insignificant.

2. We are going to run out of cheap oil.  Easy to get to oil.  Easy to process oil.  We can only change the climate so much from oil if there is only so much oil, and we are going to, effectively, run out.  Additionally, the market already supports fracking and tar sands, both of which are expensive and inefficient.  Now we're trying to buy oil from Iran while the price of oil is low.  This is as good a deal as we are likely to ever get.

3. Many of our power plants use [prodigious amounts of non-renewable energy](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/index.html) (2014, 3_1).  Those that do use renewable energy, like hydroelectric dams, do untold amounts of damage to the environment.  We stopped producing nuclear reactors in the 80's due to well intended, but erroneously founded fears.

4. The US currently has only ~[300](http://www.bna.com/us-desalination-industry-n17179876105/) desalinization plants online.  States have already started arguing over water rights.

5. Ocean acidity?  Over fishing?  If you think the animals going extinct due to poaching is bad, the 2006 numbers for over fishing called the ball at, ""all salt-water fish to be extinct by 2048."" ([NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/science/03fish.html), [Paywall Journal](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5800/787.short))  Given that technology and progress improve exponentially, I reasonably surmise 2048 is optimistic, but I don't have access to the actual paper.  Be the actual date in 2050, 2025, or 2100, it falls under the same category as oil.  ""Enough to hurt.""

6. We shifted from an industrial and production based economy towards a consumer based economy after WWII ([Quora Discussion](https://www.quora.com/When-and-how-did-the-US-make-the-shift-to-consumer-spending-as-a-leading-economic-indicator-replacing-manufacturing-production-and-exports)).  Our personal wealth is now tied directly to our dispensable income.  Contemplate the impact of rising oil prices while you compare this winter's $2/gal to last summer's $5/gal.  To be fair, this issue is the most complex and includes everything from the baby boomers' effects on the job and housing markets, erasure of the middle class, general lack of savings and/or investments, political decisions regarding fair trade/open markets, and countless other facets.

tl:dr: We are a resilient species to the point of stupidity.  At this rate, we are going to lose a game of, ""Don't Go Extinct,"" to a cascade of our own failures.

16ufynv,innovation and hope,"want to create a post where users can list recent innovation that will potentially solve some of the climate change issues

ill start with a few:  

Here are some innovative solutions cited from the past 6 years that could help address the sustainability problems:

Bar-On et al. (2018) study on declining mammal biomass:

- Cultured meat production techniques: Novel cell culture and tissue engineering methods are being developed to produce meat without raising and slaughtering livestock, helping mitigate land use impacts. (Post, 2012)

- Insect farming for animal feed: Emerging technologies enable sustainable breeding of insects like black soldier flies that can provide high-quality feed supplement for livestock, reducing agricultural land needs. (Veldkamp et al., 2012)


Newbold et al. (2020) study on future food production impacts:  

- Precision fermentation of proteins: Companies are using precision fermentation to produce protein-rich foods like cultured dairy without the land use footprint of livestock. (Perfect Day, 2016) 

- Indoor vertical farming: Controlled environment agriculture using minimal land and resources indoors is being scaled up for urban locations near populations. (AeroFarms, 2017)


Jambeck et al. (2015) study on ocean plastic pollution:

- Plastic waste pyrolysis: Thermal and chemical recycling technologies can convert mixed plastic waste into fuels and waxes, preventing plastic leakage. (Agilyx, 2016)

- Biodegradable plastic alternatives: Many startups are developing sustainable bioplastics derived from agricultural residues or microbes that can degrade in ocean environments. (Bio circulating, 2018)

----------

Here are 5 innovations/discoveries from the past 3 years that are helping to address the issue of global warming:

1. Direct air capture technology - In 2021, Climeworks opened the world's largest direct air capture plant in Iceland that captures CO2 directly from the air. This provides a way to actively remove CO2 already in the atmosphere. (Climeworks, 2021)

2. Lower-cost solar panels - Significant improvements in solar panel efficiency and manufacturing have driven costs down around 89% in the last decade. This is helping solar become one of the cheapest sources of new electricity. (IRENA, 2021) 

3. Low-carbon building materials - Companies are developing innovative building materials like low-carbon concrete and mass timber that can significantly reduce embodied carbon in construction. (Materials startup Anthropic raises $55M, 2021)

4. Green hydrogen production - Technologies for producing hydrogen via renewable energy instead of fossil fuels are advancing. This could enable decarbonization of hard-to-electrify sectors like shipping and heavy industry. (Sandia engineers make big renewable hydrogen leap, 2021)

5. Carbon sequestration in soil - Large-scale field trials demonstrate practices like reduced tillage, cover crops and biochar additions can sequester significant carbon in farmland soils.

I decided to find out how the various energy sources compared so I entered $100.00/month for Natural Gas, Electricity, Fuel Oil and Propane.  I was a surprised that the highest carbon emitter per $100 was electricity.  I guess this says electricity in Indiana relies too much on fossil fuels, like coal, AND that electricity is cheap, meaning you get a lot of electricity for $100 and therefore a lot of coal goes into its generation.  

My follow-up question, since far too much electricity in Southern Indiana is generated with coal, would I be better off heating my house and hot water with natural gas until such time that the local electricity is more environmentally friendly?

188nb9h,"C4 documentary ""The Big British Beef Battle"" 1st Dec 2023","Ade Adepitan explores the impact of cattle farming and looks for ways to influence choice.

I really like the way this was done. Adepitan discovered two really important things about the psychology of change. 1. If you tell people what they *should* do, they will resist, even if they think you're right. 2. If you present the options of what people *can* do and the information is well presented, they will feel that making the better choice was their own idea.

For those who haven't seen it, there was an experiment that failed utterly, and another that had a lasting positive impact.

Experiment 1 was sticking warning labels on supermarket shelves with strongly worded messages about greenhouse emissions resulting from industrial cattle farming, such as ""Beef is killing the planet!"" Customers did not respond well, many were angry at the messenger, and he had to concede total defeat.

Experiment 2 was pure genius: A works canteen in which burgers and meat pies are the staple of the majority of customers. Resistance to the idea of giving up beef was high. The canteen was re-branded in the style of a '50s diner and the menu posters included simple, matter-of-fact information about the relative impacts of the various products on offer: ""A chicken burger puts 7 times less CO2 into the atmosphere than a beef burger"" was the tagline on the Cluckin' Saviour burger, for example. Another was ""This beef burger has the same carbon footprint as driving your car 30 miles."" To cut a long story short, the canteen's consumption of beef was reduced by about three quarters and when he returned months later it had not reverted. Not because the customers were lectured but because they talked among themselves about what they had learned and made informed choices. Adepitan concluded that since food labelling already includes information about carbs, fat and all that, why not also include ""carbon footprint"" information? Don't tell people what to do, don't make it political, just give them the information and allow them to make the smart choice.

Ade has previously advocated banning cattle farming, and you only have to look at the YouTube comments to see how people have reacted to that, but this was a much better approach in my opinion. Admittedly he's preaching to the accidentally converted in my case because I cut my red meat consumption by at least 90% several years ago for personal health reasons rather than environmental, but all the same I learned a lot (he didn't just make it up, he consulted scientists and I have no reason to doubt the information) and I may even give up beef entirely as a result.

88lqy0,Need help with developing a carbon footprint calculator,"Hi everyone,
I've been a long time anonymous lurker on Reddit but recently created this id to share some work I've been doing in terms of our carbon footprint.
The one thing that I've been wrangling in my brain is how to perceive how everyday choices we make have an impact on the climate. For example me driving bit faster to reach office sooner or consuming coffee in a papercup vs using a ceramic one, etc. Secondly, I realized that all of the carbon footprint calculators out there provide a footprint estimate in Kg of CO2. But this number doesn't seem to be intuitive for us to understand.

In order to address the above, I have created a bunch of spreadsheets each calculating the carbon footprint of an everyday scenario. Also, I've converted the footprint in KgCO2e into the approximate time it would take for an average tree to absorb (sequester) this CO2. The idea being that time in days/months/years is easier to comprehend than weight of a gas.

I have created a repository of these spreadsheets in this Github repo: https://github.com/bearhugger404/climateChangeCalcs

What I'm hoping to get out of this post:
1) Your feedback on the methodology & assumptions I have made
2) What other everyday scenarios can we calculate the footprints
3) Change the constants that I have used in my calculations such as region specific carbon mix for electricity (me being from Ontario, have used the carbon footprint of the Ontario utility), units - km vs mile, kg vs lb, etc
4) MOST IMPORTANTLY - volunteers to work on the above items

For the future - if there's sufficient interest in this kind of tools, consider developing a web/mobile app customized to a user profile

I recently had an idea for an app that can do the following:

\- Have activities available that can be tracked and which are relevant to climate change (e.g. using less electricity, using less water, recycling plastic, shopping organic options, etc.). The user can engage in those activities and track their progress in the app. 

\- Have competitive or collaborative challenges such as: recycle 10 plastic bottles this month, or recycle 10,000 plastic bottles as the whole community for this month. As users recycle the bottles or pursue any carbon footprint reducing goal, they keep track of their progress on the app and the app converts those actions into a carbon footprint metric (e.g. CO2 reduced, water consumption reduced, etc.).

\- Users and/or communities that are able to accomplish climate impact goals such as in the recycling example above would receive rewards (e.g. a $20 gift card to a socially impactful organization such as Allbirds shoes).

\- The app would have insights and reminders in regards to what specific actions people can take to make a difference in reducing their carbon footprint.

\- People would be able to keep track of their climate impact over time (e.g. CO2 emissions saved, recycled bottles, water consumption reduced, etc.).

\- There would be a social community to discuss, challenge, and hold people accountable towards activities that make a difference in the climate change area.

Would anybody be interested in using something like this? I added a poll to get a gauge for interest behind this. Also, are there other features that I missed that could be useful or engaging that can empower people to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to combating climate change?

You can read the full article and other interesting articles at [https://nevertoolate.world](https://nevertoolate.world/), the environmental blog dedicated to bringing you the latest news and information on climate change and its impact on our daily lives.

Carbon Offsetting: A Solution or a Band-Aid?

Climate change and global warming are two of the most pressing issues that the world is facing today. The increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon emissions, has led to a rise in global temperatures, causing natural disasters and other environmental problems. One of the solutions that have been proposed to address this issue is carbon offsetting. But is it a solution or just a band-aid?

Carbon offsetting is a process where individuals or companies purchase carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint. Carbon footprint refers to the amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted by an individual or organisation. Carbon offsetting is done by investing in renewable energy projects or other sustainability initiatives that reduce carbon emissions. The idea behind carbon offsetting is that by investing in these projects, the carbon emissions that are offset will help to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the individual or organisation.

While carbon offsetting may seem like a good solution to reduce carbon emissions, it has been criticised by some as just a band-aid solution. Critics argue that carbon offsetting does not address the root cause of the problem, which is the over-reliance on fossil fuels. They argue that instead of investing in carbon offsetting, individuals and organisations should focus on reducing their carbon emissions by adopting clean energy and other sustainable practices.

Despite the criticism, carbon offsetting has gained popularity in recent years, particularly after the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. The Paris Agreement is an international agreement that aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement encourages countries to take climate action and reduce their carbon emissions. Carbon offsetting is seen as one of the ways that countries can achieve their carbon reduction targets.

In conclusion, carbon offsetting is a solution that has both its supporters and critics. While it may not be the ultimate solution to address climate change, it is a step in the right direction. It is important for individuals and organisations to reduce their carbon footprint by adopting sustainable practices and investing in clean energy. By doing so, we can work towards a carbon-neutral future and mitigate the effects of climate change.

13srwqk,The climate change discussion should center on planned obsolescence,"Manufacturing of cars and appliances are major contributors to climate change, and it has long been known that corporations intentionally engineer them to begin to fail at a certain point- often after the warranty has expired.  Corporations should be held accountable to create goods that are built to last for a reasonable period of time.  It is not okay that one could purchase a washer and dryer in the 1980s and expect it to last 30+ years with some minor repairs, yet nowadays we are lucky to have them for 5 years (and often any repairs will cost as much as buying a new set).",1685143865.0,27,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/13srwqk/the_climate_change_discussion_should_center_on/,manufacturing goods,Positive
1bz6hqy,Naive question: how reliable are developing world reported emissions?,"A lot of commentary on climate policy takes for granted the various reported annual emissions per capita by country, and while obviously no measure can be perfect I was wondering if anybody had any knowledge specifically of how developing world emissions are counted and how reliable the methods are.

The UN Environmental Programme website says that ""national emissions are estimated by combining data on types of activity with the emissions typically produced by those activities. So, if you know how much carbon dioxide steelmaking produces, and you know how much steel is produced in your country, you can estimate the total quantity of emissions from the steel sector."" But is this at all reliable when countries have unreliable national statistics, and huge informal sectors of their economies?

Take a country like Nigeria, where we don't even know the [actual population](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/06/20/why-nobody-knows-how-many-nigerians-there-are) of the country. Its economy is 65% informal, so the ability to record and evaluate carbon-emitting activity is compromised in principle (and the IMF seems to use very strange metrics like satellite-measured light emissions to estimate even that). One [study](https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-10158#:~:text=The%20estimates%20indicate%20that%20emissions,manufacturing%20and%20other%20services%20sectors.) I found even suggested that informal activity is generally worse for carbon emissions per value added, because it is functionally exempt from regulation. Or consider the [reliance of households](https://www.theafricareport.com/336784/nigeria-despite-huge-investment-grid-collapse-worsens-electricity-woes/) on generators for power rather than the grid, surely this means household consumption of fuel is systematically underreported?

Are climate policy commentators missing a trick here, or are there established ways to account for the uncertainty in the reported stats? Even rich countries like Qatar's official UNFCC stats are seemingly outdated by [more than a decade](https://e360.yale.edu/features/undercounted-emissions-un-climate-change#:~:text=Because%20of%20lax%20rules%2C%20national,targets%2C%20jeopardizing%20global%20climate%20agreements.). The article linked is very good and mentions specific gaps between reported and actual emissions for specific sectors and countries on which we have data (and acknowledges that the gaps are worse in the developing world), but nothing I've found seems to have anything to say on how emissions reporting could even work in countries that don't have the state capacity to carry out a census. If we're using light pollution as the proxy measure (as seems to be one of the main measures of economic activity in the developing world), is that even conceivably generating useful data on emissions?

For what it's worth I morally believe that the developing world deserves catch-up emissions if it means that their living standards converge with the developed world, I'm just concerned that we might not even know what developing countries are currently emitting.

ok01v6,Electric cars being treated as a panacea?,"I like in the UK, and it seems that not a day goes by without there being some mention of electric cars on the news. They seem to be the main focus of both policy and the media's attention. This makes sense given quite how many motorists there are and how it's become the dominant mode of transport over the last few decades. There is other mention of industrial strategy and decarbonising the energy grid, for instance, but getting people to swap their petrol/diesel cars for electric/hybrid seems to be the main aim. 

The thing is, I've only heard one person mention that swapping over to electric cars has a huge environmental cost. It seems to me that, as if often the case with issues like climate change, a simple solution is being applied to an incredibly complex issue. Sure, everyone having an electric car would be good for air quality and that's by no means a bad thing, and it would also reduce the UK's carbon emissions significantly. But what about the resources needed to build the electric cars? From what I understand, mining lithium alone is an incredibly environmentally damaging process. On top of that you've got all the other aspects of building a car. It seems, at times, like the climate crisis is being discussed in isolation with no mention of the ecological crisis. Clearly both are one and the same, but it often doesn't seem that way when you listen to debates on the radio. 

Am I missing something here though? Is it actually a lot less environmentally damaging to build a car than I think. Have car manufacturers made the process a lot greener? Would the benefits of everyone switching to electric cars by 2040 outweigh any environmental costs of doing so? Or is it just another weak capitalist solution to an issue capitalism created. In other words, it's great because car companies get to sell more cars, but in actual fact the point is that there should be more investment in public transport and people should buy cars less frequently and keep the car they have a lot longer. Also, it just seems like it'd be outsourcing carbon emissions/environment degradation to countries where the raw materials for building cars are mined. 

Happy to be proven wrong here though, as I'm no expert on these things!",1626251408.0,12,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ok01v6/electric_cars_being_treated_as_a_panacea/,manufacturing goods,Negative
1fvnu5d,Will geopolitical fragmentation kill / slow down the energy transition? ,"With the war in Ukraine, everybody is now aware that depending on other nations for your energy supply is a bad idea. Recently, even the progressive policy like the Inflation Reduction Act meant to boost solar, wind, etc has been bundled with big tarriffs on Chinese EVs, batteries, solar panels, silicon and subsidies for domestic production. Some kind of economic nationalism is making a comeback all over the world, both Trump and Kamala has this sort of Anti-China attitude, making me think of SSP3, the super-fragmented sceanario where everybody gets real concerned about national security. It seems clear to me that the nations of the world are trying not to become too dependant on solar panels and wind turbines manufactured in China. 

I can imagine two ways this goes. Firstly, maybe everybody tries to produce solar and wind themselves and the competition becomes a race to decarbonize. This could be good - if everybody was building solar and wind at the rate of China in an effort to dominate the market and compete I'd sleep a lot easier at night. But could it be the case that maybe solar and wind have become too linked to China - maybe their solar panels are so cheap because of their endless subsidies that nobody can compete and they are rejected by the nations of the world, just like how Europe now doesn't buy Russian gas. If the USA only allows solar panels produced domestically to be installed, or even just mostly domestic solar panels, won't this likely slow down the energy transition, as it will drive up the price of solar panels as compared with the cheap Chinese ones and thus reduce the competitiveness of solar as compared with gas or coal? In the extreme sceanarios where China becomes a total pariah and nobody wants to buy their solar panels perhaps countries go for coal if they have it l just because its domestically available and doesn't depend on any imports.

But this raises another question - this geopolitical fragmentation will probably also apply to fossil fuels to some degree, no? The example I used at the beginning of this post was Russia, who weren't selling solar panels but gas. The middle east, for instance, could become such a quagmire or conflicting political affiliations that buying oil from it could get risky politically and economically. This could drive countries towards renewables I suppose, but it could also drive them to use domestically available fossil fuels instead - maybe coal, since most countries don't have a big domestic supply of oil. Nevertheless, it would probably drive up the price of fossil fuels and maybe balance out the increase in price that would come with producing solar panels or wind mills domestically. Just today Biden commenting about bombing Iranian oil feilds sent the price of oil up 5% for instance.

What do you guys think? Is geopolitical fragmentation going to help or hurt? As nations try to on-shore their energy production will that mean a shift to renewables or the retvrn of King Coal?",1728005520.0,10,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1fvnu5d/will_geopolitical_fragmentation_kill_slow_down/,manufacturing goods,Positive

Article - 

""Dark, dark thoughts echo in my mind these days. As reluctant as I am to share them with you, perhaps I also have a certain responsibility to. This one — and I don’t recommend you read this essay if you’re at all feeling anxious or depressed — goes like this.

Here’s the way that I think about the future — don’t worry, this isn’t the thought itself, just the context. The 30s are going to be the decade of global warming (aka “climate change”) turning catastrophic. Megafire, megaflood, megatyphoon, “heat domes” — all these will replace the gentle seasons as we once thought of them. The 40s, the decade when mass extinction — already accelerating — begins to upend the basic systems of our civilization. And the 50s will be the decade of the Final Goodbye — when our civilisation’s systems simply crash and come to a halt, food, air, water, medicine, all in short supply, because we cannot produce them anymore, having killed the living planet.

That much you should already be able to feel. In the searing temperatures of the twin heat domes still covering much of the planet. In the way that much of the planet can’t get vaccines for a new plague. Or the way that a new plague is simply being left to breed new variants, each more infectious and deadly than the last.

What I’ve described to you is a set of megatrends. But beneath them runs another one, perhaps the grimmest of all.

The age of the Great Dying has begun.

I know that sounds grandiose, melodramatic, and faintly ridiculous. I don’t want it to be true, and I don’t write it for hyperbole’s sake. Let me simply present you with some facts that will explain what I mean — and leave you, probably, as chilled as I am.

A grim threshold was recently crossed. 4 million people around the world are now dead of Covid. How many people is that? More than in all the wars in the last half century or so. It’s nearly the population of a country like Denmark. It’s a staggering number. And it’s only just the beginning. Let me come back to it, though. For now, let’s call it 5 million, because even epidemiologists will agree it’s certainly a dramatic underestimate.

Another such line was crossed, too. Extreme temperatures now kill more than 5 million people a year. That number, too, is going to rise dramatically, because we’re only at the very beginning of a trend of runaway warming.

Put those together, and you already have 10 million people dead. In the last year or so. From a new pandemic, and from a warming planet. Ten million people.

How many is that? It’s more than the populations of Denmark and New Zealand. More than the population of New York City or London.

Let me say it again. Already — in this past year or so — ten million people are dead. Of things that did not exist a few years ago. A new pandemic, and a warming planet. More people are already dead from the new catastrophes we’ve made than make up entire countries.

Maybe now you see a little bit what I mean by this especially grim term “the Age of the Great Dying.” Still think it’s hyperbole, exaggeration, overstatement? (Maybe you do, if you’re a certain kind of privileged white American. So try imagining being the families of one of those ten million people who are already dead.)

Ten million dead and counting. I want you to reflect on that and think about it carefully. Did you know? Why didn’t you? What does it mean? Should you be indifferent to it? Is your ignorance manufactured for the benefit of elites, perhaps?

Ten million dead in one year from Covid and global warming. That’s how staggeringly fast what I’ve called “the Age of the Great Dying” is happening.

The crucial questions are: how many more will there be, and how fast?

The answers are not good. Covid is going endemic. Nobody cares about vaccinating the world, except a handful of doctors and scientists. Rich Westerners couldn't care less, so their governments don’t care, so Covid’s exploding worldwide. You know the story: new variants emerge, that are vaccine resistant, and everybody’s at risk from them, even in the rich West. Covid is becoming a new plague — it’s not just a pandemic anymore, a thing that goes away after a couple of years.

All that’s confirmed by the fact that the trend is accelerating. See that chart above? This last year or two’s 4 million deaths are just a beginning. The curve is bending upwards. That’s an ominous, horrific line to see. It hasn’t even hit an inflection point yet. The exponent is still growing. That means, in hard terms, we should expect to see double that number every year or two. 8 million? 16 million? 32 million? All these are very, very real possibilities.

But Covid’s not the only game of death in town.

Warming’s already killed five million people this year, roughly. We hear about the small catastrophes — a few hundred dead in Canada, another few in California, and so on. Of course those deaths are terrible and tragic and they matter. But the number of excess deaths ascribe to extreme temperatures far, far exceeds those. People simply dropping dead of heatstrokes, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary issues, asthma attacks, and so on. That’s how you get five million dead of extreme heat already.

You can see that this summer is severely, severely abnormal. It’s shattered even the worst predictions. The twin heat domes lingering over the planet made parts of Canada as hot as the hottest place on earth, Jacobabad, Pakistan. The heat is off the charts almost everywhere on the planet. Take a look, for example, at this picture of planet earth.

Warming has only just begun. We’re already at five million dead a year. The temperature has barely even risen one full degree yet. We’re on course to hit four degrees or more. And every degree the temperature rises — the global mean — deaths will occur probably at exponentially greater rates. Barely hitting one degree puts us at five million deaths per year. Two? Probably easily an order of magnitude greater than that — fifty. Three? Five hundred. Four? Let’s not even go there.

If you don’t get why, just imagine how badly our civilisation is going to break. Just one degree of warming and Canada’s on fire. Now imagine two. Still think that power grid is going to supply the air conditioning that keeps you comfortable? Who’s going to be able to live in places like Las Vegas and California — or India, Pakistan, Iran, and, well, much of the planet? At three, the planet’s tropics have become Fire Belts, and societies simply stop working, as climate refugees flee by the millions, and even in survivable cities, simply going outside is taking your life into your own hands. And I haven’t even mentioned wet bulb temperature yet, which means: it’s impossible for you to survive, period.

Put just those two catastrophes together — global warming and Covid — and you have exponentially rising death rates over the foreseeable future. We hit ten million dead a year — snap — just like that, faster than you probably believed could happen. But that number is easily going to rise far, far higher — twenty, fifty, a hundred — faster than you can believe, too.

The human mind does not do well with exponential growth, and it doesn’t do well with death. That’s why most of us are in a desperately feigned indifference. Addicted to our dumb selfies and reality TV and violence and porn and consumerism harder than ever. We are trying, rather pathetically, to deny what’s right in front of our eyes.

The staggering toll of the catastrophes we face is not set in some distant, remote future. It is beginning to happen right here, right now.

The Age of the Great Dying has begun.

It’s not a joke, and it’s not a drill. If we were a saner kind of being than the vicious, greedy, domineering, hierarchically submissive primates we are — we might even care more. Enough to stop it. As it is, though, you can see another trend, hidden beneath the mass graves of the dead of this new Dark Age.

An even greater indifference.""",1626148069.0,9,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/oj7k11/article_the_age_of_the_great_dying_is_beginning/,manufacturing goods,Negative

2lguej,How to change the minds of deniers.,"Having discussed climate change for many years, the recurring theme is that deniers find climate change suspiciously convenient for left wing political causes. They smell a rat. And actually, I agree there is one. Just not where they think.

If you're out to make money in a fraudulent way, it makes good sense to base it on a core of truth. Some real, extant phenomenon. If it's wholly fabricated you will be easily found out. But if the basis for your scheme is unassailably true, and you can lead your opponents to attack that instead of the part of your scheme where the lie is hiding, they will make fools of themselves in the process. In essence, you can trick your opposition into discrediting itself. 

In this case, the false dichotomy we're presented with is that either AGW is a hoax altogether, or it's real and the only possible solution is cap and trade. Which conservatives rightly identify as a means of redistributing money from the first world to the third. They make a superficially convincing case that this is justified, but anyone who runs in those circles knows that they have deeper ideological reasons for wanting to do such a thing. 

Conservatives figure this out, but wrongly intuit that the whole thing must be a hoax. As if something must be 100% fraudulent or 100% legit. So, they attack the science supporting AGW. And they fail, because that's not where the lie is hidden. It's in the proposed solution and the idea that no other effective means of mitigating or reversing climate change exist. Embarrassed by the mockery they receive, deniers stubbornly double down on their denial, try to manufacture scandals and disproofs, get caught in this, are further embarrassed, double down even more and so on.

This is the same very simple trap that American Christians were caught in, with respect to evolution. The idea was floated that if evolution is true, then so is atheism. So many notable public Christian speakers took it upon themselves to begin the process of undermining acceptance of evolution. Which was the wrong way to go, since evolution is factually true. They should instead have focused on discrediting the idea that atheism necessarily follows from evolution, as moderate Christians do.  

Instead they made asses of themselves, built a reputation for science denial, the embarrassment led them to double down on their position, fabricate evidence against evolution, fabricate ""evolutionist scandals"", and the general circus of retardation that surrounds any movement founded on the denial of something that is incontrovertibly true. 

Now, maybe you don't have any sympathy for those kinds of people. I wouldn't blame you. But there are more and less effective ways of dissolving obstruction to climate action. Mockery and argument are not effective. The former only further entrenches them, the latter is ineffective because they have by now had time to amass reams and reams of apologetics.

Detailing for them the anatomy of the scheme described earlier in this post has been extremely effective for me. It ""clicks"" with them. They recognize in it what they found suspicious about climate change, but also where they went wrong, and it shows them a new direction to go which permits them to accept AGW without losing face, without caving to cap and trade, and instead making them vocal proponents of technological solutions like thorium based nuclear, solar thermal (and PV for homes), electric cars (especially Tesla as they're American made and quite sexy), OTEC, offshore wind and current turbines, possibly geo-engineering, and so on.

If you're a proponent of cap and trade, look at it this way: This method at least partially unfucks their brain. They will no longer outright deny AGW, and since the solution is at least partly technological anyway, it earns another supporter of those projects.

fdugan,Solutions.,"Unfortunately many of the proposed solutions today are flawed. Solar panels (not to be confused with solar plants that use mirrors) and electric propelled vehicles produce fewer emissions on their own but at the end of their useable life provide us with far more pollution than they prevented. The amount of emissions that come from mining the material from the batterys is slightly lower but leaves the largest holes in the planet we have ever made. While saving the state of the environment so we can survive it is important we must be sure not to create a new problem while solving the old one.

&#x200B;

To that end I have a few proposed solutions:

&#x200B;

1) To help with vehicle emissions keep your old car, but ask manufacturers to produce a different kind of hybrid. The car I am suggesting has an electric engine a small battery bank and a gas generator rather than normal engine. 

&#x200B;

This will make a vehicle that always runs on the most efficient consumption of gasoline while not requiring battery banks that are massive and perpetuate the mining problem. The vehicle being a hybrid will be able to charge itself so we do not have to produce large powerplants to compensate for the new strain on the grids electric cars would make. Also it would produce vehicles the size of cars with the pulling capacity of tractors that if built correctly should get three times the gas mileage of a modern car.

&#x200B;

2) Do not just reduce emissions, plant vegetation. There are many places on our planet that have shown they can support more plant life with a little help from wells or other methods to divert water. CO2 while not the number one green house gas like water vapor is the number one human produced green house gas. Most vegetation take that gas in and breath out oxygen. My proposition is to find the plant that converts it at the best rate and spread in to areas of low vegetation. 

&#x200B;

In this we are reducing CO2 and increasing Oxygen. There are a number of other effects this will have such as increasing the amount of plant and animal life on the planet. The sciences produced in an undertaking of a project like this may also help of in terraforming should we move beyond our own planet. HOWEVER, I am not a scientist and the effects of altering these environments should be studied before hand.

&#x200B;

3) Research and vote with your wallet. Purchase items with recycled or reused components. Stop buying items with only one use that do not bio degrade. Glass items being made of silica and certain plastics require less heat to be reused. The more heat an item requires to melt the more emissions come from recycling it. Know the health risks before buying a new item because it sounds good. Paper straws for example sound nice but they flake off treated material in the liquid that is bad for you, while plastic straws are washable and can be melted down into new straws later. If companies notice a buying trend towards environmentally more friendly products they will change to produce those.

&#x200B;

4) Encourage companies in the same method in the step above to use materials that were procured by removing pollution in the environment. If you are willing to pay as much more from something made from the trash island in middle of the ocean known to be the size of Texas as you are for a reclaimed wood desk or better name brand products and compared to generics, companies will go get that trash because it's worth more than making new garbage, and they will do it in mass because fewer trips to get more product saves money.

&#x200B;

5) Petition your government for more dam turbine and air turbine power. Ask for more solar reflection and less solar panel energy.

&#x200B;

While they do not produce power as condistantly they do produce just as much. Unlike the other methods these three use forces of nature to turn the turbines. Wind and water turn it with motion that is already happening, and solar reflection boils water turning a turbine.

&#x200B;

6) Increase efficiency in items that do burn or create heat for energy. Smoke from a fire is gassed and fuels not being burned off properly, and noise in an engine is in efficiency. Buy items with technology that reduces these with better technology once your old item has run the course of it's useable life.

&#x200B;

7) Upgrade less often. Most air pollution comes from manufacturing as opposed to vehicles. The more you buy new things while you can use old things you still have the more you contribute to climate change.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That is all I had, please post your own solutions. I am interested to hear how other people wish to help this problem.",1583410883.0,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/fdugan/solutions/,manufacturing goods,Positive
2j6m95,Is climate change going to solve itself?,"I'm a climate change activist...I'm a member of a local group that lobbies our elected officials, I participate in climate marches, I write letters to the editors about global warming. However, recently, I've seen some articles that have caused me to wonder if global warming is already on the path to being solved. 

“By 2020 investing in a home solar system with a 20-year life span, plus some small-scale home battery technology and an electric car, will pay for itself in six to eight years for the average consumer in Germany, Italy, Spain, and much of the rest of Europe.”

http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/27/ubs-investors-renewables-revolution

Granted, electricity prices in Spain are 28c/kwh compared with 12c/kwh in the US, but that still means that solar + home battery would at least pay for itself by 2020. Once people start leaving the grid for their own home power storage, the prices for everyone else staying on the grid go up, which in turn, drives more people to leave the grid for home storage...it's a postivie reinforcement loop. Solar + home batteries will get cheaper which will indirectly make grid electricity more expensive. And this calculation is done using current solar prices (they will most certainly have fallen a lot by 2020) and uses the apparently conservative assumption that existing battery technology will get down to $100/kwh, just due to efficiencies in large scale manufacturing, not due to any battery breakthroughs ([source](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/08/20/tesla-motors-incs-gigafactory-may-be-more-revoluti.aspx)).

So this has me doubting the need to continue being a climate change activist. Sure, getting a carbon tax law passed would greatly accelerate this process, but it looks like this solar + home battery timeline fits within one of the timelines in which we avoid catastrophic climate change. ""Pathway 2: Less stringent near-term reductions, high net-negative emissions after 2050"" ([source](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/350_or_bust/pdfs/Not_Just_a_Number-v3.pdf). We would still need to figure out a good carbon capture strategy, though. I guess I need someone to talk me down and explain that the above scenario isn't enough to solve climate change.

16z72x0,Case against climate change alarmism.,"We have been polluting the air since the industrial revolution. In the last 200 years the global temperature has increased 1 degree C. From the average temp. So we are already living in the times of climate change. But at the same time. There is no catastrophic events happening. Our daily lives are pretty good. We are living in the most prosperous times ever.

So how can one say that unless we do something right now we are all going to be screwed in the next 20 years?

Same line we were told 20 years ago with global warming. And same thing my parents were told with the next ice age. Before them it was overpopulation. None of the predictions came true.

1848v93,Does the fact that CO2 is considered 'plant food' imply that it cannot also be a greenhouse gas?,"CO2, like most molecules, can perform more than one function in the entire universe. And like all molecules, CO2 has a specific radiation absorption spectrum and one that is predominantly in the near-infrared. Chemists, physicists, the US Military and others use absorption spectral data from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology spectral database](https://webbook.nist.gov/).

&nbsp;

NIST's absorption spectral data is critical for various applications, from military design of heat-seeking missiles to astrophysical analysis of planetary atmospheres. And most electronic CO2 gas detectors measure the amount of [infrared radiation absorbed](https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C124389&Type=IR-SPEC&Index=1#IR-SPEC) in a given amount of air - where the devices have an infrared emitter and an infrared sensor, which detects the amount of infrared radiation absored by the air.

&nbsp;


One doesn't need a degree in atmospheric physics to understand, that if atmospheric CO2 is increased, that the increased CO2 will slow the rate at which the sun-warmed Earth can cool, thereby increasing global temperature - [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21691). Conceptually, increased CO2 acts as a thickening blanket that traps heat. That's not to say that CO2 has been the key or intial driver of climate change in the distant past.

&nbsp;

When not considering other factors, increased atmospheric CO2 generally increases plant growth. However, just like humans cannot only live on carbohydrates, plants cannot on live of CO2 alone, as they also require other nutrients. And unsurprisingly, plants and non-human animals can also be affected by increased heat stress, floods, wildfires and droughts.

&nbsp;

----

Well, what does all of this mean? The imperative is clear, global CO2 emissions need to be reduced - and if anyone can design a $1 device that removes gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere, then that's all that would be needed - if not, then we have to reduce global CO2 emissions by other means - including moving much of our energy supply to the cheapest form of energy in history: Solar, and obviously also include wind, hydro, tidal energy and nuclear.",1700998622.0,0,210,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1848v93/does_the_fact_that_co2_is_considered_plant_food/,global warming,Positive

I have a family member who doesn't believe in climate change. 

The title of this post is basically his main argument. 

We were sitting outside a few weeks ago (it was scorching hot) and he randomly brings up climate change.

To paraphrase. 

""Climate change is bullshit! They had hot summers 50 years ago and nobody screamed climate change.""

I'm not educated enough on the subject to argue with him, so I tried talking about something else. I've tried arguing with him before, but to no avail. 

The way I look at it is: 

Tempaturates are changing everywhere and there's mountains of evidence supporting global warming. 

If confronted with this evidence, he screams conspiracy and digs up stuff that supports his argument. 

Mainly, I want to destroy his argument about ""50 years ago there was no global warming.""

18vd69x,Unpopular opinion. This is extremely solvable...,"A friendly reminder to the doomers that technology... exists. Climate change can be solved. From an engineering perspective it's not even a particularly complex problem to solve. We solve thermal imbalance problems on every satellite launched. Think of the Earth as just a really big satellite. It will require hundreds of billions of dollars annually to fund those solutions and that's the real problem, but as soon as the resources are allocated, global warming can be undone in a handful of years. Seriously.

Yes, our opportunity to transition to a zero emission economy has come and gone, which leaves one remaining extremely achievable option to pursue while the oligarchs drag their feet on fossil fuels; geo-engineering. Is solar modification the best solution? hell no. That would have probably been to systematically raise taxes on fossil fuels to subsidize the clean energy transition starting 50 years ago, but that's water under the bridge. Geo-engineering is the only remaining option that can actually correct the thermal imbalance caused by the CO2 already emitted that would otherwise take thousands of years for nature to correct.

There are several technologies that already exist to solve this problem. Oh and if you don't like acid rain from sulfer hydroxide injection you've read about from anti geo-engineering misinformation then it's a good thing that dozens of alternative technologies exist to solve the same problem. Marine cloud brightening, enhanced weathering, electrolytic carbon capture, phytoplankton or kelp sequestration, and just painting every man made surface white to reflect light back into space are all workable options. That's how we solve thermal problems on satellites. Just reflect and emit more light back into space. If that seems simple, it's because it is.

I keep reading articles that consider geo-engineering as some great evil that will encourage fossil fuel use till the end of time. That's like refusing pain pills because you want the maximum amount of motivation for your body to fight it's cancer. How about we acknowledge that's a false dichotomy and do both? Transition to a zero emission economy over the realistic hundred years it will take while we counter the negative effects we're already experiencing. Want to do you part?

1bvraip,I don’t mean to be harsh,"I’m a regular reader of r/climatechange.  I don’t mean to be harsh about the concerns expressed in this sub.  Here’s why I am skeptical of the need for an immediate all hands on deck effort to curb anthropogenic (corrected from  anthropologic) CO2.  

I am a science and engineer guy, retired.  

I am concerned about human practices that harm the environment. 

At the same time I am concerned we are making decisions “When the data are not as good as we would like”.  These are words of Donald Kennedy, NSF Director on making decisions based on data - that was 40 some years ago.  We may be putting all of our eggs in the wrong basket.  Slow down, we need to get it right.  I’ll be gone but my kids will not.  

There are three major things about current climate forecasting and climate perspectives that bother me. 

1. The predictions of the climate models as a group are not as good as the historic data - that’s from an uncertainty perspective.  If you look at the noise of the historic data and the quality of the of match of the models to that data, it is pretty good.  It should be as the parameters in each model are tweaked until a good match is achieved.  When the model prediction runs are made, the models as a group  vary dramatically.  That’s a measure of the uncertainty of how well we understand the driving forces controlling climate. The climate scientists do not agree on the relative magnitude of the driving forces controlling the Earths temperature.  This shows up in the model forecasts of how quickly the Earth will warm up.  There is a wide spread in the forecast of how fast the Earth will warm up.  Why is this important - do we have 10 years or a century to work the issue?  The big knob in the models is CO2.  The models have hung their hat on CO2.  We can take some relief that the predictions have been high.  Maybe the models are missing something.  We need to keep working the models. 

2. Today, climate change is a hot topic loaded with real data, analysis, projections, multitudes of ongoing work as well as unknowns, opinions and emotion.   It’s a battle ground that would be best left in the court of science.  However it’s not contained there.  The battle has spilled into the headlines, legal system, politics, social media and even into art museums - Mono Lisa did nothing wrong but still received a taste of tomato soup.  

3. Climate science has gotten to be a big business.  The media chase climate change stories with the same vigor as they chase the UK Royals.  Politicians have jumped on this band wagon early and hard.  We now allocate enormous financial resources to study all aspects of climate change.  Just Google “Climate and ______”.  Put anything you want it for the blank and you will always a find link to money spent.  My favorite is “time” - we might be losing one of our planned negative seconds!  We are spending way too much money on climate studies that have nothing to do with solving the problem.  Your “Climate and _____” exercise just showed that. Obviously there are way too many people jumping into the business of climate change.  The hysteria has enabled them line their pockets with cash.  Do we really need all this expense to granulize how a 1 degree uptick in average global temperature could effect every object on earth.   I don’t believe a climate change obsession at this level is beneficial.  It’s getting way ahead of the science and draining dollars away from useful work.

1few8ds,Water Vapor Hasn't increased in Arid Regions,"Those in the know here (just a few?) understand that CO2 alone cannot explain the global temperature increase.  The radiant exchange effect (i.e. greenhouse gas) is well-known and undisputed, but explains less than half the measured global air temperature rise.  Best to use change since 1958 since when accepted CO2 global measurements began at the Mauna Loa Station.  Earlier measurements around the globe by chemical methods are widely disputed.  Regardless, CO2 alone can't explain the temperature rise for any period.

Climate models include ""additional effects"", triggered by an initial rise from a CO2 increase.  The biggest effect is an increase in water vapor, since the dominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.  This goes back to the 1800's, where the Clausius-Clapeyron relation was used to calculate an increase in water vapor due to an increased air temperature.  That is for steady-state conditions, with unlimited liquid water available to evaporate.  That is true over the oceans, yet air coming off large areas of ocean averages only 70% relative humidity (at all air temperatures), so isn't saturated (100% r.h.), which the C-C relation requires.  I haven't researched the reason, but expect it has to do with hot humid air constantly rising to colder elevations where it condenses and rains out.

Regardless of theories, has water vapor actually increased?

A Jan 2024 paper found that water vapor hasn't changed in arid regions.  A view of the globe shows most of the land is arid (Western North and South America, most of Africa and Mediterranean, Central Asia, Australia).  Summary for the public:

[https://news.ucar.edu/132936/climate-change-isnt-producing-expected-increase-atmospheric-moisture-over-dry-regions#:\~:text=A%20basic%20rule%20of%20climate,as%20the%20planet%20becomes%20warmer](https://news.ucar.edu/132936/climate-change-isnt-producing-expected-increase-atmospheric-moisture-over-dry-regions#:~:text=A%20basic%20rule%20of%20climate,as%20the%20planet%20becomes%20warmer)

The academic paper:

[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2302480120#:\~:text=In%20observations%2C%20this%20increase%20in,arid%2Fsemi%2Darid%20regions](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2302480120#:~:text=In%20observations%2C%20this%20increase%20in,arid%2Fsemi%2Darid%20regions)

The actual data is much different than climate model predictions, which likely means they over-estimate future global warming.  One possible reason is that there isn't sufficient liquid water to evaporate and keep the r.h. constant at the higher air temperature.  If true, that would increase the specific humidity, which is what matters in radiant exchange (total mass of water vapor).

I also found these interesting earlier articles and papers:

2022 General description for the public (and any reader not already up to speed on the narrative):

[https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/steamy-relationships-how-atmospheric-water-vapor-amplifies-earths-greenhouse-effect/](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/steamy-relationships-how-atmospheric-water-vapor-amplifies-earths-greenhouse-effect/)

A June 2022 paper found water vapor has increased \~1%/decade:

[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JD036728](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JD036728)

They make this strange comment about the data sources which don't fit the narrative:

""... it seems possible that decreases in humidity in some data sets may not be real and we are confident that water vapor is increasing with warming of climate.""

So the data doesn't verify it?  Need to rely on ""confident""?

Exploring Space, reviving Extinct Species, discovering the Mysteries of Earth's Past, figuring out Quantum Physics, turning Sci-Fi Technology real, not being Prejudiced becoming Common Sense, is this really just a Dream now...?

Many people were extremely rude to me because I said I believed we could change this, calling me stupid, insensitive, ignorant, saying that people like me are the problem and that I should just accepted we are doomed and that Humanity should just be extinct...

I always tried to keep a positive view, but it's becoming impossible to do so, not because **I** believe it's over, but because everyone tells me I should not have hope and even feel BAD for having hope, I really wanted to believe we were doing something, I wanted to believe the future was not lost, but everyone seems to consider this just a stupid dream now...

So why should I keep trying? Why should I keep living if Humanity will be doomed in a few years according to everyone..? Why should I have dreams if I'm gonna be alive when the World ends..? Why should I keep trying if everyone tells me I'm stupid for trying..?

1g52cxx,Could a cooling event save us from further global warming?,"I was researching lately about cooling events that happened in the last 10,000 years, being the last one Little Ice Age, and was wondering if one of them happens again this century, it could possibly reverse the current global warming trend, and even put us back into near-Ice Age conditions.

For that to happen though, what is necessary?

I was investigating the Younger Dryas, which happened around 12,000 years ago, and that cooling event was one of the most impressive ones, putting the Northern Hemisphere almost back to the Ice Age, and the main cause was likely the sudden increase of freshwater in the North Atlantic, disrupting or near collapsing the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). 

If something like that would happen this century, with the Greenlandic ice sheet melting in record time, would that be enough to collapse the AMOC and put us back to some sort of Younger Dryas? And therefore make glacial sheets expand again in a matter of decades or centuries?",1729093188.0,23,119,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1g52cxx/could_a_cooling_event_save_us_from_further_global/,global warming,Positive
1bogpjo,"Save the world, or save the economy: why not both?","One argument I keep hearing from those that deny climate change, is that any steps we take to reduce our emissions and prevent runaway global warming will result in the destruction of our economy and society. They make it seem like we have to choose to either live in a prosperous and free world, or stop climate change from happening at the expense of everything we know. 

To me, this is clearly a false dichotomy. I believe that we can, if sufficient actions are taken in time, prevent the most serious impacts of climate change, without destroying our socioeconomic system. I’ve heard about the various economic impacts that climate change will have. But I’ve not read much of the socioeconomic benefits that would come from the various actions that are required to be made to prevent climate change.

1avueog,Question about ocean temperature rise (thermodynamics),"Hi all. The oceans are acidifying at the fastest rate in the last 300 million years, as a result of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. If you look at the geological record, rapid increases in ocean acidification are usually followed by mass extinctions of marine lifeforms. Having said that, I recently stumbled across the following argument on Twitter regarding ocean temperatures:

""HUMANS DO NOT CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING BECAUSE OF THERMODYNAMICS: Scarcely a day goes by without us being warned of coastal inundation by rising seas due to global warming by elite leftists who are non-scientific.  Why on earth do we attribute any heating of the oceans to carbon dioxide when there is a far more apparent culprit and when such a straightforward examination of the thermodynamics renders it impossible.
Carbon dioxide, we are told, traps heat irradiated by the oceans, which warms the oceans and melts the polar ice caps. While this seems a plausible proposition at first glance, when one actually examines it closely, a major flaw emerges.  Water takes a lot of energy to heat up, and air doesn’t contain much. In fact, on a volume/volume basis, the ratio of heat capacities is about 3300 to 1.  This is a thermodynamic issue.  Climate scientists aligned with Gates and WEF are scammers who are bad at math. 
 
This means that heating 1 liter of water by 1˚C would take 3300 liters of air that was 2˚C hotter, or 1 liter of air that was about 3300˚C hotter!  Unless you're selling propaganda for a carbon tax like Gates is, this shouldn't surprise anyone.  They are using this as a confiscation of property event.    For example, if you ran a cold bath and then tried to heat it by putting a dozen heaters in the room, does anyone believe the water would ever get hot?  The problem gets even stickier when you consider the size of the ocean.  

There is too much water on the skin of Earth and not enough air.  The ocean contains a colossal 1,500,000,000,000,000,000,000 liters of water! To heat it, even by a small amount, takes a staggering amount of energy.  Not even the sun can provide.  

To heat it by a mere 1˚C, for example, an astonishing 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules of energy are required.  Let’s put this amount of energy in perspective.  If we all turned off all our appliances, lived in caves, and then devoted every coal, nuclear, gas, hydro, wind, and solar power plant to just heating the ocean, it would take a breathtaking 32,000 years to heat the ocean by just this 1˚C!  We are being lied to by the elites.""

Given the current intensive global warming, we investigate the AIS mass changes from January 2003 to December 2022, using the newly released satellite gravimetry and atmospheric datasets. The results show that the continuous mass loss in the AIS between 2003 and 2020 was 141.8 ± 55.6 Gt yr−1 . However, the AIS showed a record-breaking mass gain of 129.7 ± 69.6 Gt yr −1 between 2021 and 2022. During this period, the mass gain over the East AIS and Antarctic Peninsula was unprecedented within the past two decades, and it outpaced the mass loss in the Amundsen sector of the West AIS from 2003 to 2022. Basin-scale analysis shows that the mass gain mainly occurred over Wilhelm II Land, Queen Mary Land, Wilkes Land, and the Antarctic Peninsula due to anomalously enhanced precipitation. Further investigation reveals that during 2021–2022, a pair of symmetrically distributed high-low pressure systems, located at approximately 120°W and 60°E in the Southern Ocean, drove the observed abnormal precipitation and mass accumulation.",1702327184.0,0,115,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0863,global warming,Positive

165x443,Why Arctic has warmed a lot and Antarctica not.,"A major question and one I posed here several times, with no reasonable answers.  Indeed, this is the major defect of climate models, that most of the globally-averaged warming is due to an annual-averaged temperature increase in the Arctic and N. Europe, whereas little warming in the Southern Hemisphere and none in Antarctica.  Yes, modelers added ad-hoc additions like changes in the Polar Vortex to make their models fit past data, but no certainty that will give valid predictions for the future.

I ran across this 2020 research paper which studies the issue.  Note they also state no appreciable melting of Antarctic ice, despite continual claims in the media.  The paper runs computer models to try to understand.  Their conclusion is that the high elevation of most of Antarctic land (ex. 11,000 ft plateau at South Pole) blocks the flow of humid air which is said to flow stronger to the North Pole due to climate change (added to fit data?).  Interesting that they make no mention of the feedback effect of melting sea ice exposing more dark ocean to absorb the sun's rays, which is said to account for 30% of the warming in the Arctic.  Antarctica is surrounded by a large area of sea ice, so wonder why not also significant there.  Their modeling shows that if Antarctic ice was at sea level, like at the North Pole, the warming from increased humid air flow would only increase Winter temperatures rather than Summer.  Not a bad thing, though we don't get to vote, plus Antarctica is not lowering.

Not sure this paper gives a reasonable explanation, but is an attempt.  Feel free to give your thoughtful comments, for those able to read and process information, not just ""believe"".  Just posting ""denier"" isn't thoughtful.  Not my research paper, just throwing it out to readers.

Summary (Claude.ai):  
The article argues that while climate activists often focus on the existential threat of climate change and the deaths caused by natural disasters, the data shows that deaths from climate-related disasters have actually declined dramatically over the past century. It cites statistics showing that global annual deaths from storms, floods, droughts, wildfires, and extreme temperatures have declined by 96% over the past 100 years, from almost 500,000 deaths per year to just 14,000 in 2020. The article suggests that economic growth and technological innovation have allowed humans to better adapt to and withstand the impacts of climate-related disasters. It argues that the data on disaster deaths tells a more positive story about climate change impacts than the narrative often presented by climate activists and the media. The article contends that only looking at the total economic costs of disasters, without accounting for the growth in valuable infrastructure and population, can create a misleading impression about the increasing frequency and severity of climate-related disasters. **Overall, the article presents a perspective that challenges the dominant narrative around the human impacts of climate change, emphasizing the progress that has been made in reducing climate-related deaths over time.**

1cjaxr7,How to make sense of the lack of correlation between paleo CO2 levels and temperature? And the issue of double counting,"Hi,

This place is apparently for rational discussions (so let's avoid tribalization I have zero agenda and actually care about understanding climatology (which seems rare on reddit))

One major issue with CO2 being the major driver of global warming is its lack of correlation with historical records of temperature (that is, before the 20th century).

This paper also shows that cloud cover has meaningfully reduced during the last decades and that it theoretically explain 86% of warming, therefore regardless of the former issue, there is a major unaddressed issue in climatology that I believe very few people realize, it is the issue of double or **triple counting**.

Basically datasets shows that CO2 has increased this century, but so does reduced cloud cover and increased water vapor. All three factors are proven potent ""greenhouses/warming effects"" and all three can be argued to be nearly sufficent alone to account for observed warming. As the observed warming is significantly lower than their cummulated effects, either two of the three has a badly understood mechanism/factor that alter their potency, either all three have a role but then the role of two of the threes must be seen as abnormally milder than theoretically expected to avoid double/triple counting (excess) of temperature increase.

[https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=131993](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=131993)

**Edit:**

&#x200B;

Source evaluation is a partial heuristic at best.

There are countless empirical sources for reduced cloud cover and increased water vapor, that leads to the triple counting problem so let's not pathetically hyperfocus on this one study and miss the points.

Here are two authoritative journal (and most importantly it simply is satellite data so raw empirism)

The co2 h2o feedback being the main driver is merely an hypothesis with almost no meaningful solid direct empirical backing. There is indeed a theoretical feedback, in fact maths says h2o leads to more co2 emissions (ocean) than co2 leads to h2o emissions. Let alone the fact that co2 considerably reduce plants evapotranspiration (\~40%)

Besides, this co2 feedback only try to address the water vapor *cause* of increase but **not** its double counting, therefore it is completely off topic with my point.

Secondly this neither address cloud cover (which is only moderately correlated with water vapor)",1714748731.0,0,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1cjaxr7/how_to_make_sense_of_the_lack_of_correlation/,global warming,Positive

Analysis of Berkeley Earth data shows a significant difference in the rate of temperature increase between summer and winter in Greenland, with winter warming over four times more rapidly than summer.

Significant seasonal variation in the rate of warming is not specific to Greenland but is a global phenomenon at similar latitudes.

There is a correlation between warming rate and latitude, with a decreasing trend in warming rate as we move from north to south.

17aiq0y,"Anthropogenic Climate Change and David Suzuki and Scientific American and The Smithsonian. Oh, and Some Academia.","Too good to just post in a comment.  I think.

Ok, I'll reply. I really don't need to have academia tell me anything about Anthropogenic Climate Change. All that I need to do is look and see. I live in California. I know, I know get it all out... Here in California we have a thing called Atmospheric Rivers that occasionally happened and usually happened when an El Nino or Nina what occur. El Ninos and Ninas had a cycle. Every 3 to 5 years one would occur. They don't anymore. They're still called El Nino or Nina but they are something different and the cycle is different. There isn't one. When I heard on our local news that it may be another El whatever and it ""petered out"" and didn't occur then WTF? NOAA wanted to start categorizing Atmospheric Rivers because of their rising frequency. Back to Back slamming the Sierras. Took So Cal out of a 20 year drought in a 2yrs. Before NOAA starting to categorize atmospheric rivers they didn't care about it because it was infrequent and they just didn't care. They do now.

I remember in the late 80's David Suzuki had a 3hr special on PBS called Global Warming. It was about three of the biggest CRAY supercomputers. They were at some university in CA (UCLA?), a Japanese Corporation and in Britain somewhere. Three different places that had at the time the biggest computers. All three were independently trying to look in to the future and create a model for what earth will look like in X amount of years. If there was a trend and how would that look like. It took years because any small variance or slight difference in data changed the outcome drastically. The biggest stumbling block for them at the end was, of all things, clouds. How did clouds work with heat and radiation bouncing, absorbed and or reflecting. They didn't know and it was complex. They finally had what they thought was the best data to plug in to the supercomputers. I forgot which one was the best or had the biggest computer array but one came up with the best ""outlook"". Sea level rising and taking away The Keys, The Barrier Islands, Parts of Boston, Parts of the California Coast all the way up to Alaska, New York City doesn't fair well either. High winds, tornadoes, floods slamming the Midwest then excessive heat destroying our ""bread basket"". The Great Lakes dumping down into the Mississippi causing massive flooding. Greater and more frequent hurricanes up the Eastern Seaboard. Greater and more frequent tornadoes ripping through tornado alley.

It was fucked up other than CA becoming more tropical, which it is, because I like the tropics. Anyhow, this was predicted in the 80's. Oil corporations knew about how bad burning things in order to propel ourselves was bad for us in the 70's but probably before that. The 50's.

3fs933,Looking for best experimental evidence that the increase in CO2 has caused global warming,"I have to confess I posted a caustic, inflammatory rant against climate change advocates in an AMA thread featuring ""climate scientists"" yesterday.  I regret that, and as penance am doing my own research on this issue today, trying to keep an open mind.  I'm looking for  a straightforward experiment, preferably at say the high school level or even lower (not that I can't comprehend higher, just looking for clarity) that demonstrates unequivocally that purported increases in CO2 in the atmosphere have caused global warming. I think this is very important, because science at its core is about experiments, its not about showing respect for the opinions of people in lab coats with more degrees than you.

As far as experiments, example of what I am *not* looking for, is say, throwing alka-seltzer in one bottle and leaving another bottle untouched and then shining a light on them.  That isn't relevant to me because the purported increases of CO2 in the atmosphere is only about 100 parts per million.  However, I did find a promising experiment  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPRd5GT0v0I), by Mythbusters.  And it looked pretty compelling to begin with.  But the more I thought about it, it seems like there could be some fairly underhanded duplicity going on with it, which if true is a shame.  

One of the kid ""scientists"" queries an ""expert from UC Berkley"" if such an experiment is even possible  She responds, ""We can do experiments on a small scale in the lab...but its a challenge, I think it can be done, but its a challenge.""

But after that remark, they immediately start setting up an impressive experiment that if its results were as ultimately implied, it would demonstrate unequivocally that increased CO2 in the atmosphere has caused global warming, asfaic.  So why her remark that it was so difficult.  Its a warning sign I think.  

To handle the CO2 injection, they bring in ""Manish Gupta a gas monitoring expert from Los Gatos research""  The narrator says, ""the amount of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere is about 350 parts per million, but amounts that small are no problem for this [the Los Gatos] gear... so they can up the greenhouse gas levels in minutely accurate increments.""  However, what is very strange, is that he *never* says what level of CO2 was actually introduced into the glass box.  In fact at one point the display on the equipment says ""CO2 = 7.32%"".  Is this the level of CO2 they used?  Did they just jump through hoops to imply they would replicate earth atmosphere conditions as far as CO2 and then actually increase that amount by what, almost 200 fold?  It kind of looks that way. Really a shame if they were deceiving children. And if true, it implies something more broadly about the veracity of the climate change theory in general, as Mythbusters I think is supposed to have a fairly high reputation.

I have scoured the internet looking for substantive commentary on this video without success.  Is this the best there is as far as demonstrating CO2 global warming in the lab?  What *is* the most compelling experiment if not this?  I'm ready to be convinced if possible.

I am a serial startup founder, and after leaving my previous venture, I aimed to create something to combat climate change in a startup-oriented way.

The Problem as I see it from a startup perspective:  
***People want to help the environment but often hesitate to engage in climate-related activities.***

The main reasons why people are not engaging:  
*1) The high barrier to participation (competing for people's attention is challenging with a significantly reduced attention span).*  
*2) People can't quantify their impact if they take action (e.g., how exactly (in numbers and percent) does trash sorting affect their CO2 footprint).*  
*3) There's a lack of trust in current non-profits/initiatives due to opaque reporting.*  
*4) They doubt the number of people willing to participate, leading to decreased motivation.*

I've addressed these issues in the app that I've developed.

**How it works? (Detailed)**

*Core Mechanics*

Firstly you receive a digital seed. You need to water it. You water it by completing lessons.

By completing 2 lessons you water your digital seed to a tree. And the PineOx team plants a real tree.

The first lesson is the CO2 calculator. It calculates your annual CO2 footprint based on your habits and lifestyle. It allows the PineOx app to calculate for how long planting one tree will make you CO2 neutral.

After planting your first tree the countdown starts. It shows you for how long you will remain carbon neutral. To remain CO2 neutral you need to continue completing lessons and plant trees.

&#x200B;

*Inviting Friends, Gifting Trees & Tree Impact Map*

The first seed is free and is given to every user who joins PineOx.

To open access to the following seed you need to watch some ads or invite a friend. You can invite any amount of friends. Every friend who joined via your invite code gives you an additional seed.

Every user of PineOx has Tree Impact. Tree impact represents planted trees. It includes trees planted by you plus trees planted by friends you invited and subsequently by friends invited by your friends.

Right after installation, you can make 3 gifts for your friends. You can make gifts only to users who haven’t yet been present on the platform. After claiming their gift they join your network and their planted trees influence your tree impact.

&#x200B;

*Transparency & Actual Tree Planting*

Because many green initiatives aren’t transparent we made Tree Impact Map. A tree impact map allows you to see the tree impact of every member of the community. Information about who invited who is seen by everyone. There is no option to make the account private or prevent others from seeing it.

We at PineOx plant trees by ourselves. We do not pass it to some third-party organization. You can check the image and location of every tree planted by the PineOx Team. All the images and locations for planted trees are available in the Tree Impact Map section of the app

It seems likely that they're saying that simply because it's human nature to avoid facing a sad truth. 

Not to mention, I believe for some time now it's been hot enough for arctic ice to melt and contribute further to global warming without us even doing anything; for us to fix this, not only do we have to stop contributing to the damage (which isn't happening any time soon), we have to  reverse damage: humanity needs to have a negative carbon footprint.

Global warming is very real, and climate crisis can't be ignored. The problem I'm finding is the information given to the public tells us about the problem, but doesn't give us a solution? I've been digging through the internet looking for a list of alternative actions people can do instead of the actions that leave a carbon footprint. The articles with headlines saying ""things you can do to stop climate change"", but what I read are suggestions that sound more like holistic health habits than anything to do with climate.

I would say, starting immediately, recycling is mandatory, and we need classes and videos showing us and teaching us what can and cannot be recycled, and how to prep things we will recycle. 

Discontinue use of fossil fuels, there are clean energy fuel alternatives in the works, and soon there will be solar powered cars that charge themselves while you drive: imagine never having to get gas again? I'm waiting for flying cars, but I don't have information on them.

P,lastics have to go, we're already bringing our own bags to grocery stores, we have so many products stored in plastic, it's hard to imagine living without it, but it's come to a point, if we want to live, we have to live without it. There are other materials like glass or ceramic, even cardboard, that would suffice.

These are just a few ideas that would help, I'm trying to get answers and find solutions, I can't stand that this is happening, and I will do everything I can and more to restore the Earth, without the Earth, none of us would exist.

On an added note, I think they should ban guns and any type of firearms in the U.S., no one may own or purchase a gun, they will be assigned strictly to law enforcement and the military. I even have red flags about law enforcement having guns, there have been to many tragic incidents lately of the police shooting innocent people. And I know the NRA would disapprove my suggestion, I would like to talk with them about their policies, since I know nothing about them, and ask them if their children feel safe going to school?

If we make the tasks it takes to reverse climate change trendy, people will catch on, begin a new habit -intentionally, good healthy habits are the coolest things to do, they're at the top of all billboard charts, the headlines on every newspaper, in fact we need to start a global craze of good habits, and have fun cleaning up the Earth, we can restore it to a livable state, and know that we all made a difference.",1574683377.0,0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e1f461/what_do_we_need_to_change_to_stop_climate_change/,carbon footprint,Positive

uvxqrb,Easy Steps/Ways to Reduce Carbon Footprint," 

If a person throws one wrapper in the street, you'll see nothing and won't affect anything, but if 100 people throw one wrapper each, then the mess will be clearly seen. And if the same 100 people throw the wrappers for 100 days, i think the street will not remain as a street but a trash site. so you all see, how throwing one wrapper by a person thinking it's okay to throw it off and won't affect anyone CONVERTS into a trash site in just 100 days.

Now imagine how our little actions (which people think okay doing them) have contributed to and led to the current atmospheric and climate situations over the years.

so as our small Subconscious actions have aggravated the atmospheric and climate situations, in the same way, we can undo them as well by taking small CONSCIOUS actions/steps.

16k95nn,Climate Change and Its Impact on Coastal Cities: What Can We Do?,"
Hey fellow Redditors,

I wanted to start a discussion about the pressing issue of climate change and its effects on coastal cities around the world. With rising sea levels and extreme weather events becoming more frequent, it’s crucial that we talk about this and brainstorm potential solutions.

Here are a few questions to kick things off:

	1.	How has climate change already affected your local coastal area?
	2.	What initiatives or policies are being implemented in your region to address these challenges?
	3.	What can individuals do to mitigate the impact of climate change on coastal cities?
	4.	Are there any innovative technologies or projects you’ve come across that offer hope for the future?

Let’s use this thread to share information, experiences, and ideas on how we can collectively tackle this global issue. Remember to be respectful and open-minded in your discussions.

10d9qrn,The tilt angle of Earth's axis impact on the climate and seasons as we know them...,"This has intrigued me for quite some time and I thought a good place to start challenging opinions on climate change would be here so I will begin with this...

Is our emphasis on climate change exaggerated and could it lead to us trying to fix things well beyond our control which then causes more issues later down the road? 

I'll include the below piece from NASA with regards to the tilt angle of Earth's axis. 

[https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Milankovitch/milankovitch\_2.php#:\~:text=Today%2C%20the%20Earth's%20axis%20is,know%20them%20can%20become%20exaggerated](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Milankovitch/milankovitch_2.php#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20Earth's%20axis%20is,know%20them%20can%20become%20exaggerated).

&#x200B;

It's my belief that the extreme weather we are currently experiencing is due to the earth possibly entering a new cycle with regards to it's tilt angle. I think it's quite possible earth has already been through this cycle, fluctuating carbon dioxide levels etc, and like a body when it is ""unwell"" it will attempt to shake it off; think of a fever for example, getting hot then cold, your body is trying to fight the infection. Not saying humans are an infection but I think increased carbon dioxide levels are certainly an infection on the planet and it's obviously not good for humans. The heatwaves we experience followed by cold snaps in a simplistic way is the planet trying to heal itself... a lot of people concerned with the weather and climate seem to be focused on the planet heating up but I fear the next ice age in all honesty. 

&#x200B;

Anyway ramble off I just thought I'd include that to give people points to pick at or something and maybe create some discussion which works toward deradicalizing some of the more vociferous activists.",1673859439.0,0,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/10d9qrn/the_tilt_angle_of_earths_axis_impact_on_the/,extreme weather,Positive
dk8nad,The IPCC should rely more on history books than on computer models.,"""Flooding, dryness, heat or cold waves: Today everything is supposed to be a sign of the apocalypse - this was not always the case. Whenever the sun shines for a few days in a row and it gets warmer than 30 degrees or longer rains fall and the water levels of the rivers rise, some media and ""experts"" claim that climate change is now hitting with full force. A look at history shows that there have always been weather capers and that people knew how to deal with them as well as with their consequences, without immediately developing hysterical end-of-the-world fantasies. This is also the case in the Saxon capital Dresden.

Persistently high temperatures and the resulting droughts plagued the people here as early as 1473, 1504, 1563, 1590, 1616, 1642, 1790 (at that time, this even led to the Kursachsen Peasant Uprising), 1842, 1874, 1893, 1904, 1911, 1921, 1934, 1935 and 1954. The chronicle of the city council for 1473 reported: ""Summer was so hot and dry that drinking water was only available for money"". And in 1590 it was said: ""Because of great drought the mills stopped. The Elbe was almost dried up."" The latter also happened in 1954, when the level of the river fell below ten centimetres and once again the legendary ""starvation stones"" appeared on the ground.

If it wasn't too hot and too dry or too wet, severe frost became a problem. This occurred in particular in the years 1416, 1466, 1524, 1597, 1612, 1664 and 1673 to 1679, whereby the cold waves in the 17th century were effects of the so-called ""Little Ice Age"". Now the mills failed instead of due to lack of water due to icing, and in the woods ""many hundreds of deer ... fell dead"". In addition to hunger, there was also a shortage of wine, because the frost already set in in late summer and the grapes spoiled.

The biggest weather-related scourge of the population in Dresden, which lies directly on the Elbe, was of course the constantly recurring, devastating floods, during which the level of the river rose over seven metres, which would today lead to the declaration of the highest possible alarm level.

Between the years 1200 and 2013 there must have been around 35 such extreme flood events. This means that the alleged ""millennium floods"" of 2002 (Elbe gauge at the Augustus Bridge next to the Residenz Castle: 9.40 metres) and 2013 (gauge: 8.76 metres) were by no means one-off events and thus indications of the alleged climate change in the present. Water levels were similarly high in 1845 (8.77 metres), 1501 and 1784 (8.57 metres each), 1655 (8.38 metres), 1862 and 1799 (8.24 metres each).

There are no concrete measurements from the time before, which is why it is quite possible that the river swelled even more dramatically in the past. For example, during the legendary ""Magdalene Flood"" of July 1342, which afflicted the whole of Central Europe, or in the terrible flood years 1272, 1275, 1318, 1400, 1430 and 1432. Taking into account the damage mentioned in old documents, water levels of more than ten metres are conceivable.""",1571514268.0,0,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dk8nad/the_ipcc_should_rely_more_on_history_books_than/,extreme weather,Negative

ph6iyz,What am I missing?,"I have read a bit of the IPCC report and don't understand what this fuss is all about. First of all, there is nothing new, really. They are even more sure that increasing global temperatures are largely due to human emissions. Predictions are largely the same but with somewhat smaller confidence intervals. I have not compared much with previous reports but this is my understanding.

The report makes prediction of rising temperature and its effect on sea level, extreme weather, drought, heatwaves, etc. It says virtually nothing specific about how that will affect us. How many will die, loose their homes because of floods, become refugees, etc. because of climate change? I understand this is a very complex question but this is ultimately what we need to understand to weigh the potential measures against the effects.

So I have been thinking: Since the 80s, the global temperature seems to have increased about 1 degree. That means, we know what happens when the temperature increases one degree with quite a bit of certainty, we have data. Of course we don't know what happens when the global temperature increases *another* degree in the future. But most predictions in the IPCC report seem to be fairly linear functions of the temperature increase, so we should have a good indicator. So what has happened since the 80s?

I'm just wondering what I am missing here? I am very open to being corrected here. Perhaps my whole thinking is flawed somehow? Perhaps my sources are dubious? Perhaps there are other more important factors that I didn't think about? Since there is such concern I really wonder if I am missing something important. I obviously understand that it is not a good idea to warm the earth another 5 degrees or so because then we will probably see the impacts much more clearly. But based on what one degree of global temperature increase looks like, I have a hard time seeing that another degree or two will be catastrophic.

Also, the study's co-author is Friederike Otto, who's made a bit of a splash recently on German television as the poster child of ""Attribution Science"" (i.e. real-time assessments of the likelihood of extreme weather events being attributable to climate change) and I was wondering whether anyone had any thoughts on this.

amose7,Nature is more intelligent than us humans. It will get rid of us sooner than you think,"I was reading this Scientific American article and it reminded me on how we humans think we are intelligent when we are actually underestimating the greater universe, nature and all the things surrounding us. Nature is much more intelligent than what we hallucinate here.

As the [article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/hot-planet/climate-change-were-not-literally-doomed-but/) says, humans are crap on predicting the future. 

*Humans are terrible at thinking about probabilities, as every weather forecaster on the receiving end of abuse for being “wrong” well knows.*

That is because we are programmed by society to think linearly. But the universe works exponentially. What I mean is, we are probably going to experience extreme disaster much much earlier than we thought we would. I feel as if humans are predicting a dire situation for the next generation (like in this article), it will actually happen in the next few years. Maybe in the next decade, who knows?  Humans know shit about the future. When things like this happen, they accelerate exponentially and most humans fail miserably on seeing that coming. I'm not talking about human extinction but huge paradigm shift events like massive bushfires, colossal sequential hurricanes, massive draughts... you name it. Events that are enough to change humanity forever. Stuff like what WW2 was for mankind. That could be even related to how climate change will affect food supply, just like the a [famine and the volcanic eruption that changed mankind forever.](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/a-volcanic-eruption-with-global-repercussions-an-irishman-s-diary-on-1816-the-year-without-a-summer-1.2760797)

To me, nature has given a lot of warnings on what's going on, it is like the planet is having a fever because it's trying to fight us like antibodies fighting viruses in our own bodies. 

No I'm not pessimistic, I think this will end up being a good thing. Why? Because the faster we get violently slapped in the face by nature, the better. We are not quite there yet. But once we are humbled back to our primitive, maybe we will be able to think like the nature wants us to think again, and react exponentially. And therefore, save the planet because there will be no deniers left when **REAL** disaster hits.

sdi6ww,"""The Best Years Are Over""","05/29/1966, 1:00 p.m. - from [DER SPIEGEL 23/1966](https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/die-besten-jahre-sind-vorueber-a-e54b1b81-0002-0001-0000-000046407576) 

SPIEGEL: Dr. von Rudloff, what do you think the temperature will be today?

VON RUDLOFF: I guess it will be about 25 degrees.

SPIEGEL:We should enjoy it, because you predicted a cold future. These days, reports of your forecast have been going through the press that our weather in the next few years, or, as you said in a lecture, ""for the rest of the 20th century"" will be somewhat cooler than it has been so far.

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, I presented this view at the International Meteorological Conference in Munich, and it is also included in a book of mine that will be published soon. However, it was only a cautious forecast, which was then partly exaggerated in the press.

SPIEGEL: So we're not heading for a new ice age?

VON RUDLOFF: It's hardly possible to draw completely reliable conclusions about the future. But with some probability we can say that our climate will not go beyond the framework of earlier decades. We are not heading toward desertification or marshlandification or an ice age. But it seems that the climate optimum for this generation is behind us, and that in the next few decades colder winters will tend to become more frequent and dry-warm summers rarer.

SPIEGEL: Last year's rainy summer seems to prove you right. The last few weeks, on the other hand, are again pointing toward a nice summer - what, by the way, is your forecast for the coming summer?

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, well, I don't want to get in the way of my colleagues from the German Weather Service. My personal opinion is that the summer of l966 will bring above-average temperatures, and it may also be a bit too dry.

SPIEGEL: But this forecast doesn't really fit into your theory.

VON RUDLOFF: Of course, there are always events that don't fit in at all. And on the other hand, last summer was not as bad as it was made out to be. If you compare it with history, you'll find that in the last hundred or two hundred years there must have been twenty summers that were even worse.

SPIEGEL: We are among the least enviable journalists who have to write about the weather. As soon as it rains for four days in a row or a few snowflakes fall in March, our colleagues at the editorial conference immediately demand a report from us. It might help us for the future if we could get some information from you.

VON RUDLOFF: I don't know ...

SPIEGEL: What is the basis for your forecast of a cool remaining century?

VON RUDLOFF: In connection with the book I mentioned, I have been very intensively concerned with climate fluctuations, as they have been observed in Europe since the beginning of meteorological measurements and records.

SPIEGEL: Since when have such records existed?

VON RUDLOFF: The longest series of instrument observations in Europe - or even on Earth - comes from England, where a physics professor made records from 1670 onward, but only from one station.

SPIEGEL: Are such isolated measurements of sufficient value?

VON RUDLOFF: Of course, you have to take other data into account, for example, the quality of the harvest in a given year. But there are numerous other series of measurements going back to the last century, for example from Prague, Basel, Paris or Kazan in Russia. I have here, if I may show you, 14 such thick files in which the monthly climate data of 150 long-term observation series in Europe are written together.

SPIEGEL: How long did it take you to fill up these folders?

VON RUDLOFF: Eight years. And now it still has to be calculated. SPIEGEL: With an electronic brain?

VON RUDLOFF: No, I do it all with the normal brain, with two or three technicians together.

SPIEGEL: And what have you been able to glean from your 14 folders so far?

VON RUDLOFF: It can be determined that our climate, very roughly speaking, went through considerable fluctuations during this time.

SPIEGEL: Do these fluctuations follow a certain rhythm?

VON RUDLOFF: No, not at all. On the contrary. A lot has been written about supposedly regular 16-, 22- or 35-year climate cycles, but none of that is tenable.

SPIEGEL: But if we understood your lecture correctly, then you also believe in certain periodic climate ""oscillations,"" corresponding to the rhythm of sunspot activity.

VON RUDLOFF: Quite right. But the periodic fluctuations of the sunspot activity are just not exact. On average, there are eleven to twelve years between one sunspot maximum and the next, but sometimes only seven or even 17 years.

SPIEGEL: A confusing picture. But perhaps you should first explain: What are sunspots, and in what ways can they affect terrestrial weather?

VON RUDLOFF: Sunspots are cooler and darker spots on the surface of the sun - so they're not eruptions, as was previously thought, because then they would tend to be brighter and hotter. But accompanying the sunspots - and this is crucial - are the so-called solar flares ...

SPIEGEL: These are powerful gas eruptions on the sun.

VON RUDLOFF: Quite right, and these solar flares, which therefore have much higher temperatures than the surface of the sun, I think have an effect on terrestrial weather patterns.

SPIEGEL: You mean the radiation from the sun is enhanced in solar flare-rich years?

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, and the circulation of the air masses on Earth is stimulated accordingly. And now we observe that the sunspot or sun flare maxima are by no means always of the same size. Rather, we had a particularly strong, a ""secular maximum"" about once every century, about every 90 years.

SPIEGEL: When was the last century maximum?

VON RUDLOFF: We had in October 1957 the absolutely greatest maximum that ever occurred. And from this I conclude that for this century we probably have the greatest maximum behind us. Probably the next maximum, which is to be expected for 1968 or 1969, will already not be so pronounced. I expect that we are approaching a period of generally somewhat lower sunspot activity.

SPIEGEL: I guess that's the crux of your hypothesis?

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, but there are other factors as well, such as lively volcanic activity in recent years and increasing glaciation in the northern polar region.

SPIEGEL: Have we understood you correctly: In the years around a sunspot maximum, the weather is better on average ...

VON RUDLOFF: You could say that.

SPIEGEL: ... And in the years around a century maximum, it's particularly good.

VON RUDLOFF: At least around that maximum, there's a greater chance of somewhat more favorable years than we had around a minimum, for example, around 1964.

SPIEGEL: But 1964 was very nice, wasn't it?

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, 64 of all years was good, but the years before and after - 62, 63, 65 - were decidedly cool.

SPIEGEL: Dr. von Rudloff, we have here from the archives the file ""Climate Changes,"" we may read out once, it says in 1951: ""New Ice Age in Sight""; in 1953: ""Tropical Climate for Europe,"" in the same year, three weeks later: ""Solar Temperature Rising - Nevertheless, It's Getting Colder."" In 1955, there is again talk of an impending ice age; in 1957, it is then said that our climate is becoming ""increasingly windy"". In 1963, according to a British forecast, the world is again becoming ""colder and colder"", in May 1964 the Soviets prophesied: ""The earth's climate is becoming milder"". Now it is getting colder once again - according to your theory. It's tempting to patiently tack your forecast in front of the others and wait for the next one.

VON RUDLOFF: You see, my forecast is only that we are heading for normalization. But a normalization means a deterioration compared to the optimum of 1911 to 1961 and compared to the unusually good weather between 1942 and 1953.

SPIEGEL: And isn't it perhaps the atomic bombs after all? We still have those in the archive folder, too.

VON RUDLOFF: Suppose there were large atomic explosions every day in maybe 30 or 40 places on Earth, with a corresponding amount of dust kicked up into the atmosphere - I think something like that could very well cause climate deterioration.

SPIEGEL: You mean the dust particles would retain some of the solar radiation.

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, but such explosions have been relatively rare so far, so that one can neglect this point altogether. We can say with certainty that the climate deterioration we have been experiencing since 1954 has nothing to do with nuclear testing. It's different with volcanic activity.

SPIEGEL: That's probably the second pillar of your theory.

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, take, for example, the great volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, in which a huge cloud of dust - there were over 50 cubic kilometers of loose material - was spread around the earth.

SPIEGEL: Were there any effects on the weather at that time?

VON RUDLOFF: It was then that the irradiation of solar energy to the Earth was reduced by up to six percent, and the weather became cooler and more monsoonal, there were colder winters and cool summers for many years. Now in recent years volcanic activity has increased again. We had a volcanic eruption south of Iceland in 1963. And in the same year there were also big volcanic eruptions on Ball. And now there's also the fact that since about 1940 we've been able to observe an apparently increasing glaciation in the northern oceans.

SPIEGEL: Allow us some doubts. With your records - in an area that covers only a fraction of the Earth's surface - you're looking at a period of no more than 300 years, in other words, in terms of Earth history, a fraction of a second. Isn't it highly questionable from a mathematical point of view to continue calculating into the future?

VON RUDLOFF: Certainly, a great many factors are still connected with it, of course, because the atmospheric circulation covers the whole earth.

SPIEGEL: Your forecast, if we understand correctly, applies to Central Europe. But how do you assess a winter like the last one? Snow and cold in the north until March, unusually mild in the south.

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, here in Freiburg, February was the absolute mildest since measurements have been taken here at all. You just can't make a uniform statement for a larger area.

SPIEGEL: What was the forecast for last winter?

VON RUDLOFF: It was extremely varied. The German Weather Service in Offenbach, for example, had predicted above-normal, too mild temperatures for all three winter months. I myself made a forecast that the winter would probably be too cold, which I sent to Professor Scherhag in Berlin and to Offenbach.

SPIEGEL: You exchange such forecasts - a kind of colleague lottery?

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, we send each other the results.

SPIEGEL: Who won?

VON RUDLOFF: My forecast voted for the northern region, the one from the Offenbach headquarters voted for the southern region.

SPIEGEL: Something is always right.

VON RUDLOFF: It's always right somewhere, yes. But you're never going to get a hundred percent hit in the long-term forecast.

SPIEGEL: What are the average hit rates of the weather prophets at the moment?

VON RUDLOFF: In the short-term forecast from one day to the next, we already achieve hit rates of 85, sometimes even 90 percent. We long termers, I would say, are still at 65 to 70 percent, which means we still have at least 30 percent wrong forecasts.

SPIEGEL: Of course, a layman could achieve a hit rate of 65 percent with a bit of skillful guesswork anyway.

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, even our forecasts are still practically in the realm of mathematical random scatter.

SPIEGEL: So just like the old farmers' rules about the weather.

VON RUDLOFF: Some of them are 65 percent correct. Especially if they are based on well-observed regular cases, such as the Ice Saints.

SPIEGEL: Dr. von Rudloff, we don't want to offend your profession, but can meteorologists hope to ever grasp the extremely complex weather patterns scientifically and thus achieve hit rates of, say, 90 or 95 percent even in long-term forecasting?

VON RUDLOFF: It is theoretically conceivable. In practice, it is likely to remain utopian for a long time. Let's assume there are a thousand factors that determine the weather - there are probably a lot more, I would say infinity minus one factors - if you wanted to capture all these factors, you would have to set up endless mathematical formulas, which, on top of that, would change again from second to second. For example: Over grassy steppes you have a different reflection of solar radiation than over water, over snow another than over deserts, rocks or forest.

SPIEGEL: The famous mathematician John von Neumann once called weather prediction - and we quote - ""the second most difficult problem in mathematics"" after predicting human behavior.

VON RUDLOFF: Remember, classical meteorology covers only a tiny fraction of the entire weather pattern. So far, we have only the so-called pinpricks in the atmosphere - isolated measuring probes and balloons that are sent up there from time to time. In the southern hemisphere of the earth, there are practically no measurements at all over large areas. Meteorology - up to now, it's been a map with mostly white spots.

SPIEGEL: For some years now, weather satellites and electron computers have been providing meteorology with new aids that were expected to be very promising. For example, the American meteorologist Howard T. Orville - who was President Eisenhower's weather advisor - once dared to make the bold prophecy that by 1965 at the latest, it would be possible to provide daily weather forecasts as accurately as a stock market report or the page of a stock exchange book. Something like this: ""Freezing rain from 10:46 a.m. to 2:32 p.m."" or, ""Snowfall from 1:43 a.m. to 7:37 p.m.""

VON RUDLOFF: I don't think we'll get that far. Still, we have great hopes for the future from satellites and computers.

SPIEGEL: So far, it seems that meteorologists know very little about the how and why of weather patterns.
VON RUDLOFF: The satellites we have now are just a start. It seems to me that it is particularly important to accurately record the radiation processes on the sun and to use them for forecasting.

SPIEGEL: Just earlier this month, it was announced that the United States is planning a new weather observation system with several thousand automatic measuring balloons, measuring buoys in the oceans and news satellites. (See graphic.)

VON RUDLOFF: Yes, but I believe that ultimately these very elaborate systems can no longer be maintained by individual nations. It's a question of cost. I think one day only a supranational world weather bureau with thousands of machines and thousands of employees will be able to keep track of all these things. And then we will certainly be able to give somewhat more precise information.

SPIEGEL: You say ""somewhat more precise"" ...

VON RUDLOFF: We should already be able to achieve an accuracy of 80 percent, even for long-term forecasts. If we could get a picture of how the glaciation in the Arctic is increasing or decreasing through regular satellite observations, that would already help us, because such changes certainly affect our Central European weather.

SPIEGEL: The ice cap in the north - that brings us back to your hypothesis that our climate is getting cooler. It's not quite clear to us: How do you explain the increasing glaciation in the north since 1940, i.e. at a time when sunspot activity reached its century maximum, i.e. when solar radiation on Earth was just particularly high?

VON RUDLOFF: The cooling in the north has already started before this maximum. But what this is due to in detail - I would like to express myself perhaps in this way: The north was too warm for conditions beforehand, and there was actually more of a normalization.

SPIEGEL: You assume that in the next twenty or thirty years it will also become cooler here. But from everything we've just heard about the variety of weather patterns, it's probably not out of the question that it will get warmer again.

VON RUDLOFF: Not out of the question. But I do expect that this increase in ice in the north will have an effect on our climate after all.

SPIEGEL: But it's also conceivable that the ice deposits in the north will decrease again.

VON RUDLOFF: Conceivable, yes. We don't know yet.

SPIEGEL: Dr. von Rudloff, thank you very much for this interview.

7qdd1x,Need help with Wall Street Journal article,"The weekend edition of The Wall Street Journal has an article by Benny Peiser and Matt Ridley called, ""Bad Weather Is No Reason For Climate Alarm."" (I would link it, the WSJ is behind a paywall.)

Anyway, most of the article seems to try to de-link weather (extreme events) from climate, which I generally suppose is a good idea.

But they do sneak in one or two things about climate change that caught my eye.

Mainly, they claim that temperature rise is not happening nearly as fast as the IPCC has predicted (nor is the rise accelerating).

They cite a 1990 IPCC assessment that predicts a rise of 0.3C every decade, and then claim temperatures have only risen between 0.121C and 0.198C per decade (depending on which data sets are used).

I am relatively new to trying to understand climate change, and cannot really figure out what data I should be looking at or where to find it.

Can anyone credibly confirm or rebut the article's claim?

xgt7e3,Question about the certainty of earth’s co2 absorption,"Hello all, and thanks to the people who are answering these questions.

Here is my question : what is the scientific certainty of the earth’s absorption rate and is it possible that a deviation in this absorption rate could encompass the co2 emissions of humans?

So if earth is absorbing let’s say 770gt of co2 per year but we have an uncertainty of say 5%, that would put the absorption rate at 808gt, which would encompass the 40gt of emissions of humans.

So I get that the earth system is at an equilibrium and that if an excess co2 should get into the atmosphere it would likely come from fossil fuel burning (because of C13 diminishing in the atmosphere, we know it’s not volcanoes, etc), but how do we know the earth can’t cope with an extra co2 with plants reacting very quickly each year with an increase in carbon fixation.   


I kind of see it like when you‘re breathing normally (stable state) and suddenly you take a deep breath for whatever reason (change state), exhale more (negative feedback), and come back to a stable state.   


I’m also asking this disregarding the temperature change factor. I know some will say “we know this because temperature is rising”, but I’m asking this more in a “what if“ perspective of what if temperature is driven but some completely unknown factor that we haven’t considered yet, what would the co2 absorption question/answer look like?   
I Hope this makes sense…

16ymr4q,Climate sceptic Q/A,"Can someone make a pinned post with the most frequently used pseudo-arguments of the climate sceptics?

Examples:

Q: The increase from 300 ppm to 400 ppm CO2 is only +0.01%, such a small amount can obviously not have any impact.

A: The absolute increase from \~1930 to 2015 is indeed about +100 ppm, which is 0.01%. That is +0.01% of the absolute value, but about 34% increase, which has a huge effect.

&#x200B;

Q: Since 1960, polar bears in the Arctic have increased from 5,000 to over 25,000! Obviously, there is more ice!

A: Technically, there is no question about it, but the reason is hunting restrictions imposed by the Arctic states since the 1970s.

&#x200B;

Q: Only 3% of CO2 emissions are man-made! The remaining 97% come from nature. So how can humans be responsible?

A:  Nature cycles approximately 1200 billion tons of carbon annually, a process akin to its 'breathing'. The same 1200 billion tons are absorbed back by nature. Humans, on the other hand, contribute 37 billion tons of carbon annually without a corresponding natural absorption mechanism. Consequently, each year, we continue to add billions of tons of carbon to the atmosphere.

1fngn4b,Change My Mind (seriously),"Hello all. I am a climate change denier (for now), but I have recently become much more open minded in general and am ready to change my positions upon being presented with enough evidence. So here are my questions:

1. What are all the negatives of climate change, and what evidence is there to suggest that the negatives outweigh the positives?
2. Global energy production must triple over the course of the next decade. What practically feasible strategy could accomplish this while simultaneously reducing carbon-emitting energy sources?
3. Climate change rates have historically been exaggerated. Why should we trust the current predictions?
4. Is reducing carbon emissions really a more practical solution than adaptation through seawalls and other means and if so, why?

These are all genuine questions and I really am open to having my mind changed. Would love to hear your input.

EDIT: I acknowledge issues with two of my questions. #2 was based on faulty data. The increase is only 25%-30%, not triple, though even at that level of increase, the question still stands. #3 was anecdotal and based on politician's portrayal of what the science said rather than the science itself, so likely inaccurate. 

I would also like to clarify that ""climate change denier"" isn't really a great way to describe my position. It's more so that I haven't been presented with enough evidence to be convinced that climate change is so disastrous, it's worth majorly damaging our global economy in an attempt to solve or even just reduce it. 

Last clarification; I understand these are complex questions that can't be fully explored in a Reddit thread.

1byreoc,Human caused climate change. Th math doesn’t make sense. I need someone smarter to help.,"So I’m having trouble with the whole climate change narrative. I definitely believe the climate is changing. That is super apparent.

What I can’t understand is if humans impact on the climate is really that…for lack of a better word impactful. 

I’m on my phone so it might look weird but here’s the facts that I have that are easily verifiable. Let me know if I’m looking at the math wrong. 

According to [NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html) the volume of the entire earths atmosphere is 5.1 quintillion kg in total. If we look up the makeup of air and use the portion of CO2 and other trace emissions as a rough base for the composition of the atmosphere we get [0.04%](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmosphere) of the total atmosphere according to the NOAA. 

Using some quick math deductions we get a total of 204 quadrillion kg of CO2 present in the atmosphere. 

Now according to the International Energy Agency that monitors global emissions as of 2022 we produced [36.8 GIGAtons](https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-in-2022#) of emissions for the year. And that’s up by almost 1% over the previous year. Even then that only accounts for 0.00018% of the 0.04% that is the total CO2 in the atmosphere. 


To put it in my perspective just to get to a little under 2% of personal human contributions we would have to produce CO2 at the levels higher than we ever have for 100 years. That seems like a lot for a long time. 

On top of that according to this article from [Yale](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters) the parts per million/ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen to historic levels at a rate of 5ish ppm per year(im approximating here cause this post is already long) but if it were linked to our usage of fossil fuels wouldn’t it go up at the same exponential rate?  

Listen I have questions and if anybody can tell me the right numbers I should be looking at so I can believe like the rest of you lemme know but these are the numbers they give us and it looks weird.



EDIT: I’d like to thank everyone for the information and corrections. Like I said in the title I needed help from someone smarter and I’ve definitely gotten more explanation than my google search could give me lol.

18e33gy,How to evaluate a study suggesting a different relationship between CO2 and temperature?,"Curious to see from folks here how exactly I should go about critically assessing this study (sent to me by my conservative mother.

The crux of it seems to be their assertion that rising temperature causes increased CO2 instead of the other way around, which of course isn’t what a whole boatload of other studies would show.

But I’m really curious to know if this is wrong, why/how it’s wrong, basically.

One assumption in particular stuck out to me:

“Overall, natural processes of the biosphere contribute 96% to the global carbon cycle, the rest, 4%, being human emissions”

Which I’m wondering…is it right?  Or is it wrong?  If it’s right, are they just referring to a broader “carbon cycle” instead of focusing specifically on atmospheric CO2?  

That right there seems to be a pretty large assumption in their argument, since not only do they need CO2 to not be causing increased temperature, but they also need CO2 in the air to not be from humans.

I am a physics high school teacher and my students come to me for questions about climate change sometimes. I know this subreddit and the internet in general is very ""pro"" human-based climate change. I have always been on the fence of human or natural processes, especially after the mann hockey stick lawsuits. I am sure I have a lot to learn so I do not speak from a truth perspective.

As a scientist, I wonder why I cannot find simple small scale experiments that prove that basic concepts of climate change. I can easily find experiments on how it changes the biosphere once the climate HAS changed, but not necessarily what caused said change.

A few things that are hard to swallow from the physics perspective is the amount of radiation in the wavelengths absorbed by CO2 and methane is already passed the maximum absorption. Secondly, thermodynamics laws would imply as long as the external heat source remains constant the radiated object (earth) should reach equilibrium with the heat source.

I am in no way trying to prove or disprove anything, I **simply** am looking for some experiments that compare the heating of regular air (oxygen,nitrogen,etc) and air that is more ""polluted"" with greenhouse gases (higher co2 and methane etc).

There's about 1000 different sub categories to debate and argue to no end. But none of that stuff matters. Is there climate change? Perhaps something is going on. Is it unprecedented? Maybe yes, maybe no. There's graphs and charts, historical temperature records and all kinds of hand waving pointing to ""climate change"".  Except, no one talks about CO2.  The climate discussion begins with co2 and ends with subjective arguments over graphs, rain and droughts instead.

Have any of you actually thought about co2? What questions would you ask to inform yourself enough to make a decision about it? They say co2 is a pollutant and it ""traps"" heat.  Is that true? Can heat be ""trapped"" ? Is co2 really a pollutant? The answer is no to both. We can debate that if you like but the questions need to go deeper.

Did you ever ask ""how much heat"" can't escape to space?  If you did ask, can your teacher answer? Probably not.  Did you ever ask how much co2 is in our atmosphere? The answer is only .04 %. But wait! there's more!

Ask your teacher how much energy co2 absorbs.  Now, are you imagining co2 is absorbing ALL our heat and sending it straight back to earth in the form of  ""back radiation""?  Well, you would be wrong.  Water vapor makes up 95% of all greenhouse gases, but even if that doesn't make you reconsider co2's power, consider this. Co2 only absorbs light (IR) photons which are only 15µm wide. That's 15 microns. What does this mean?  It means 15µm is the weakest, coldest part of the IR spectrum. How cold? 193 K or  -80 Celsius. That's COLD. Or rather, more specifically, that's heat! Absolute zero Kelvin is the coldest you can get. That's when molecules stop moving. So even 193K is still considered heat.

Light waves, in the simplest explanation, is like a spring or a slinky toy. The smaller the spring, the more energy it contains. Stretch the spring out, the less energy it contains. X-rays, gamma rays etc, stuff that will kill you, is in the 1-2 µm range or ""short wave"".  However, after visible light hits the earth, it converts to long wave energy. Most may know this already. However, even an ice-cube emits LWIR because an ice-cube is not absolute zero Kelvin.  It has heat.  But like I said, 15µm is of the weakest part of the IR spectrum which co2 absorbs and you don't have to take my word for it.

Wien's law is the formula used to derive temperatures of a black body (something that absorbs all light waves). It's how we know the temp of stars, by analyzing the color of light being emitted and applying Wien's law. So what happens when you apply Wien's law to the IR spectrum of 15µm?

[https://rechneronline.de/spectrum/](https://rechneronline.de/spectrum/)

Do it yourself. Don't get overwhelmed by the formulas and numbers. Just edit the wavelength field to 15 then select micrometers from the drop down to the right. Hit =.  No need to worry about the other fields, they will populate accordingly.  What's the result? 193.18 K or -80C.

In conclusion. The atmosphere is warmer than -80C and it is an absolute impossibility for co2 to make it warmer with heat/energy that is -80. That's colder than my freezer and in essence, alarmists want you to believe temps colder than my freezer will overheat our atmosphere and planet.  Bring this up next time your teacher goes on a rant about ""climate change"".  This is the only argument we need to be having.

19fdn54,Discuss:,"A Historical Perspective on Climate Fluctuations leads me to believe that Human Activities driving climate change is not a unique phenomenon. If this is true, am I correct to suggest that Human Exceptionalism are wrong to moralise excessively over the global warming frenzy? 

The ongoing discourse surrounding climate change often centers on the impact of human activities on our planet's delicate ecological balance. While the role of anthropogenic factors in climate change is undeniable, it's crucial to acknowledge that Earth's climate has always been subject to fluctuations throughout its geological history.

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the Earth's climatic variability lies in the occurrence of ice ages. Over the eons, our planet has experienced multiple glacial periods, marked by the expansion of ice sheets and a subsequent rise in sea levels. Conversely, these ice ages were followed by periods of melting, leading to warmer climates. These natural cycles demonstrate the Earth's capacity for self-regulation, albeit over extended periods.

Global continental drift events have also played a significant role in shaping Earth's climate. The slow but inexorable movement of continents has influenced ocean currents, altering heat distribution across the planet. These shifts have led to changes in climate patterns, emphasizing the inherent dynamism of our planet's environmental systems. Recognizing these historical events underscores the idea that Earth's climate has always been in a state of flux.

But the causative agent that interests me the most is biological evolution.

The story of biological evolution is intricately woven into the fabric of Earth's climate history. Species have adapted and transformed over millions of years in response to changing environmental conditions. The evolution of plants, particularly their development of photosynthesis, stands out as a parallel to modern human activities. Plants, by harnessing solar energy, have influenced atmospheric composition and, in turn, climate dynamics. This serves as a poignant reminder that life on Earth has always played a role in shaping its climate.

The evolution of photosynthetic organisms, particularly marine algae and plants, played a crucial role in the initial stages of ice age development. These organisms absorbed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and released oxygen during photosynthesis. The increase in photosynthetic activity led to the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, affecting the greenhouse effect and gradually cooling the planet. Furthermore, the colonization of land by plants during the Silurian and Devonian periods increased the land area covered by vegetation.
As plants grew, they weathered rocks, releasing minerals into the oceans. This process, known as chemical weathering, consumes CO2 from the atmosphere and contributes to climate cooling.

In the current era, human activities have escalated to a level where they rival the impact of natural phenomena on the climate. The development of agriculture and industry, and the consequences of these activities on atmospheric composition are evident. The combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release vast amounts of greenhouse gases, intensifying the greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming.

And now a brief detour to discuss ""Human Exceptionalism"": 
Human exceptionalism is an ideology that asserts the unique and superior status of humans in the natural world. It posits that humans hold a special place and possess inherent qualities, such as intelligence, consciousness, and moral agency, that set them apart from and above other species. This perspective often stems from religious, philosophical, or cultural beliefs, positioning humans as distinct entities with dominion over the Earth and its resources.

From the view of scientific realism, Human Exceptionalism is obviously misguided. Evolutionary biology and ecology provide evidence of the shared ancestry and interrelatedness of all life on Earth i.e. humans are animals. The fact that we have evolved the ability to think abstractly, and have used this ability to develop moral awareness does not make us NOT animals. Why then do we place burdens upon ourselves that nature does not?

If we consider humans to be animals, and a part of nature just as plants are, parallels can be drawn between the ""actions"" and consequences they both produce. Plants evolving the capacity to sequester carbon dioxide, as well as colonising land, contributed to climate change in the form of global cooling. Humans evolving the capacity to undertake agriculture, and industry, contribute to climate change in the form of global warming. If humans are not Exceptional, why do we moralise about the effects that we (humans) have wrought upon the environment, and yet we don't do the same for other ""creatures"" (forgive my use of the word that tends to bare religious connotations)? 

Essentially, I'm asking why it matters that we are causing climate change, and why we believe that we ought to do something about that, when evidently other species are not concerned about it...",1706201127.0,0,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/19fdn54/discuss/,greenhouse gases,Positive
115vnrb,In the Name of Climate Change?," Introduction: The Morale Dilemma of Climate Change

Climate Change is a complex and very debatable topic of both political sides, each having their own facts, lies, and statistics to support their argument. However, what both sides, as well as the media, and many activists point out is the top three producers of greenhouse gases, China, India, and Russia. Each has not pledged to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, each has not taken part in the 2015 Paris summit goal. Nevertheless, a moral dilemma arises from this, is it fair to stop the developing world from outputting greenhouse gases in the name of Climate change? Is it fair to send millions of people to poverty and death in the name of of stopping green house gases and let perhaps millions more die in the future?

1ay506w,Are emissions produced from enteric fermentation by ruminant animals apart of a closed system?,"One big contributor to climate change is our agricultural system, animal agriculture being a big contributor to that because of the land use changes, emissions during life on the farm, production of animal feed, etc. However, people who defend animal agriculture say that at least with regards to emissions during life on the farm such as the methane emissions emitted during the digestive process of a cow, they'll say that these emissions don't really matter as much as fossil fuel emissions because methane emissions from the cattle itself is apart of a closed system because when the cow belches methane, it gets converted to CO2 in the atmosphere and is then taken in by plants. Something like burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas isn't apart of a closed system on the other hand because you're bringing in brand new sources of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. Defenders of animal agriculture argue that if livestock herd sizes stay the same, then no new greenhouse gases are being added to the atmosphere, and livestock herd sizes have been around the same for for the past several years now if I'm not mistaken.

Here's an example of someone making this argument:

[https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/586052-cows-are-not-the-new-coal-heres-why/](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/586052-cows-are-not-the-new-coal-heres-why/)

Some will also argue that emissions from ruminant animals were almost as high as they are now during the Pre-Columbian era, so they'll try and make the point that we didn't see an instance of climate change that's as drastic as we see today. Here's an example of a person making that argument:

[https://www.carnisostenibili.it/en/methane-emissions-from-herbivores-have-always-existed/](https://www.carnisostenibili.it/en/methane-emissions-from-herbivores-have-always-existed/)

So are these people correct, or is there some extra information which would show that livestock emissions aren't necessarily apart of a closed system, and that it is worth tackling emissions that are the result of the digestive processes of cattle and other livestock?

Why is it so bad that the climate is changing? Isn’t this nature at work, the species that can adapt will adapt and those that cannot will die off?

Will humanity be able to survive a hundred years down the line if we continue with outputting the amount of greenhouse gases we currently are?

How many species will go extinct because of climate change and how will this affect humans? I’m guessing that there would be a general trend towards less food worldwide which would mean more death due to starvation? But also don't we produce enough food to feed everyone but we just choose not to? Doesn’t a large portion of it just end up rotting/food waste?

How much of an effect does being vegetarian/veganism have on greenhouse gas emission?

What species have already been negatively affected by climate change besides the well known polar bears/coral reefs.

6jlc0z,Guy I know is vehemently against human caused climate change and posted the following. Can anyone shed light on deficiencies here?,"John M. Quinn,
As a physicist/geophysicist who has worked for the U. S. Naval Oceanographic Office and the U. S. Geological Survey for more than 30 years, and who has spent the last 8 years examining the Global Warming phenomenon (the first two of which were at the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), I have come to two conclusions.
First Global Warming is real. Second, CO2 regardless of its origin (i.e., either natural or anthropogenic) does not drive Global Warming.

The CO2 Enhanced Greenhouse Effect Theory is totally irrelevant to the Global Warming phenomenon. Why? One finds on the secular time scale that both of the X- and Y- component temporal, annual-means profiles of the Earth’s Orientation mimic exactly the Global Temperature Anomaly (GTA) annual means profile On the decade time scale one finds that the GTA mimics the Geomagnetic Dipole variations and the variations in the Earths Anomalous Rotation Rate [i.e., Excess Length of Day (ELOD) Annual Means]. The Dipole Field, the GTA and the ELOD all have a 60 year period on the decade time scale. There are many other such correlations on both time scales.

Thus, if CO2 were driving the GTA, and given the geophysical parameters that change over time in sync with the GTA, CO2 enhancements would reasonably have to drive the Earth’s dynamo which creates the Dipole Field and somehow also affects the Earth’s orientation and its rotation rate. But CO2 cannot do this because it has no pondermotive force associated with it. Furthermore, CO2 on the decade time scale lags the GTA by about 9 years according to Mauna Loa, HI Observatory data collected since 1955, which is a period of time that is at the height of anthropogenic activity. Furthermore, on the millennium time scale the time lag averages about 800 years (Monin et. al., 2001). Therefore, if CO2 were the driver of Global Warming through the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect, then it would have to violate the Principle of Cause and Effect.

While I do not know what precisely (though I know a little) causes Global Warming, I do know what does not cause it. CO2 and other greenhouse gases, anthropogenic or otherwise, are merely passive players that, like the GTA, are driven by other more dynamic forces associated with Earth’s core, the Sun, and even the Cosmos (referring to the Danish theory of cloud formation), all of which act, react, and interact in a very complex manner.
Note that the IPCC concentrates on Solar Irradiance, but ignores other solar energies such as that associated with Solar Magnetic Flux that has more than doubled since 1900. Gravity is another player in the Global Warming picture. Also note that Mars has global warming comparable to Earth’s without CO2 (Fenton, et. al., Nature, 2008). There are no Martians to either generate or enhance CO2 on Mars.

1flp4ze,Paper: The 2023 Record Temperatures: Correlation to Absorbed Shortwave Radiation Anomaly,"https://scienceofclimatechange.org/wp-content/uploads/Olilla-Record-Temperature-2023.pdf

Abstract:

According to the paradigm of the IPCC global warming is solely due to anthropogenic causes. Record-high temperatures have been measured for the summer months of 2023 and the anthropo- genic climate drivers – mainly greenhouse gases - have been named as culprits. Simple analyses reveal that the temperature increase of the year 2023 cannot be explained exclusively by anthro- pogenic climate drivers. The hypothesis of this study is to show that the main climate driver for the high temperature of 2023 has been the Absorbed Shortwave Radiation (ASR). The approach has been to apply the CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) satellite radiation measurements, which started in March 2001. Simple climate models have been applied since General Climate Models (GCM) cannot simulate cloudiness and shortwave radiation (SW) changes properly. The ASR changes are related mainly to cloudiness and aerosol particle changes. Since 2014 the global surface temperature growth rate has accelerated but this does not apply to anthropogenic climate drivers, and therefore the ASR changes are probably related to external forcings. The total Radiative Forcing (RF) according to the AR6 was 2.70 Wm-2 for the period 1750-2019. This can be compared to the change in the ASR, which was 2.01 Wm-2 from the year 2000 to the year 2023. This finding means that natural climate drivers have altogether an im- portant role in recent global warming.",1726873511.0,0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1flp4ze/paper_the_2023_record_temperatures_correlation_to/,greenhouse gases,Positive

I realize we cannot turn down fossil fuels until we have enough solar and batteries. We are so close to the potential of making a huge difference. I feel like the reasons we are not seeing progress we need is because old are too risk adverse to make the changes in rapid time. 

I think sometimes people don’t understand the severity of the problem. The models are questioned too much seeding doubt.
